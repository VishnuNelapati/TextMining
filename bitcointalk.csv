Nasdaq will also provide marketing support.Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. has agreed to provide New York-based startup Noble Markets with core technology to power a new marketplace aimed at allowing companies and institutional investors such as hedge funds to trade bitcoin and related digital-currency assets.QuoteNoble Markets venture aims to allow institutional investors to trade digital-currency assetshttp://www.wsj.com/articles/nasdaq-to-provide-trading-technology-for-bitcoin-marketplace-1427140006nasdaq & nyse producing lots of positive btc news lately. nobody would have believed that to happen just two years ago.just hoping the price follows Price will follow, when there will be something ready, or about to be released. For now it is just another positive news, yet without impact on the current price. But that is going exactly in the direction of the 'positive fundamental developments' Bitcoin needs.i think people want to see the effect of this before getting excited.at this stage traders don't react on good news anymore unless it's really good news."
2,1000682,3/24/2015,"People are afraid that they may be shorting Bitcoin down first or put a tight grip onto the price. But Bitcoin, which has a limited amount of tradable units, won't let that happen, I believe.people make rumours of any single news, even if there is very little substance. That is very typical for the purely speculative markets, and that is where we are now with Bitcoin.; "
3,1000682,3/25/2015,"Isn't this the news people have been waiting for for years?How is this not really good news though?No, Noble Markets has purchased trading software from Nasdaq. This has nothing to do with the Nasdaq exchange. PR release by a company with no track record and no customers. ;This was a purchased ad.Show of hands, Noble Markets traders?Purchased or not it's good exposure for sure. A market buy for the ad's cost would have a greater impact than flashing some words that won't be read by anyone other than bitcoiners reading reddit. Just let me say:; Thank you for your courage. the price should raising back to $380These guys see bitcoin as more than a shorting opportunity.Isn't this huge? I think it is!; excellent enough to drop the price anyway... i really think this is excellent news. Quote\x93It is a vote of confidence in bitcoin the technology,\x94 Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex Group, said in an interview. \x93Now that you are seeing big organizations providing technology, there\x92s a feeling that bitcoin is here to stay.\x94 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/bitcoin-getting-serious-as-nasdaq-nyse-step-into-digital-crazeAs it happned so often lately. Good news around, price makes a drop. In the long run it just can go up!There's still money to be made shorting BTC - but that market won't last forever.; After that, there's plenty of money to be made going the other direction."
4,1000682,3/31/2015,"If there is some serious development coming, then the price will reflect that sooner or later. For now it is just another news, without much impact on the price. This news will be excellent if there is something behind it, and these are not just words. "
5,1001696,3/24/2015,"People in here (a lot of hero and legendary members btw) told me for the last 15 months that i just need to buy and the price will go up but it always turned out to crash even more. I really think that BTC and all the bull scammers should be banned for scamming everyone. I just wrote another complaint to the PBOC btw...; Any user can view your past posts and see your negative attitude against bitcoin so nobody will belive that you bought even single bitcoin Get out with your spammy and troll posts fonzie pls.I can't believe you believed them. LOL!Stop trolling or i will ban you. Last warning!!Well this is free speak forum i guess.  are you kidding me? You are the one that should get banned for trolling. Keep your warning to yourself and imho i don't know how you didn't get banned yet for imposting an moderator.(look at me, I am a hero member)it's been a rough year till now, but Nasdaq is coming and the tide is changing. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0This belongs in the scam accusations section; This is where i originally posted it, but it seems that corrupt bitcoin bull scam moderators are trying to disguise the truth by movin it to the speculation forum, altough my first post contained nothing else than an obvious scam accusation.Sometimes you have to pay a lot (seems your case) to learn these simple rules.Second rule is to trust only your own opinion, when playing with your own money.Invest always what you can afford to lose. That is the investment's 101.Good to know, thanks for the inside infos, so i guess i should better buy all the coins(while they are still cheap) before they do it ! ME = smart money!Of course they aren't, I'm just trying to follow your logic.You bought bitcoins because you thought price would go up, right? So you were a bull? And are you saying all bulls are scammers?do your own research and buy when you think the price is right.never take any advice for granted. even not when the advice comes from a legendary member.Bull scammers are more likely (hidden) sellers, they are mostly early adopters or criminals with stolen coins who are trying to unload their thousands of coins without crashing the market and so they try to encourage newbies like me to put in more bids so that they can dump on us with less slippage. ;Besides I do think BTC price will increase significantly in a few months. (Don't take that as an enforcing advice).Unless you were forced to buy you can't blame anybody except yourself.You need to learn to make your own decisions. I bought my first BTC at almost $1k :/ but I've learned since there.Don't feed this troll, i even got pm from his newly created account ""speculation moderator"" that i'll be baned from weekend.Rofl i can't belive this, how can some one could belive these words?"
6,1001696,3/25/2015,"You actually follow the advise from users on the speculation subforum of bitcointalk?You have obviously been very selective with the post you decide to read, i have seen just as many posts from members saying that BTC will die and to cash out ASAP before you loose everything, no one can say 100% what the market will do, thats why they call it speculation.I really do believe now that there are big entities trying to push the price even lower while accumulating as many BTC as humanly possible! They know about the future potential of BTC!OP is saving those bearish posts to blame them when (if) bitcoin moons after he's sold everything.That is why people have brains to do their own actions and judgements. I cant believe that you seriously believe unknown strangers in the internet..So dumping 20k btc on the open market is a good way to accumulate? What sorcery is this? And why is buying volume non-existent at these ""lower levels""?I have doing a bit of research on this Whale Club and those guy are making a pretty penny shorting BTC, they wont let the price get too high just yet, they have enough market pull to send the price up close to $300 then short the market and make a killing watching the price go down about $50, there is a trend here and money to be made if you know how to read the market.Yes i think you could be right there.OP should file a Ruble scam claim to Putin "
7,1001696,3/28/2015,bitcoin gave me anal-herpes If their advice really works&#65292;they will only keep it to themselves
8,1001698,3/24/2015,"I'm not saying that because of that BTC is going to $0, just saying that breaking that long term trend line right now was a even more bearish turn of events.PS: Sure, in 2011 price broke a log support trend line too (at $4 and then crashed to $2), but I argue that for a lot of reasons you can't really compare these two different scenarios. Price, marketcap, and overall landscape were totally different.One thing is sure, the BTC markets have been unhealthy for quite a while, and they are not getting better at all for now.There's not more to add, current market conditions paint a pretty scary picture.And finally, the bid sum on all exchanges (one of the most important aspects in considering a possible sustainable uptrend) is still relentlessly decreasing and is now sitting at scary low levels (bitstamp at $2.6M, Huobi at $1.2M etc)Secondly, on a more short term time frame, price has broken below the support trend line since the $150 bottom, and now became pretty strong resistance:First of all, the 1w chart still looks like this (the most important multi-year long term support trend line left that was broken with a spectacular crash):Let's just consider the BTC market technicals for one second.Also I didn't add the fact that recent pumps have been supported by a lot of borrowed money in longs ($24M+ now on bitfinex) rather than by fresh new fiat on exchanges. These longs will just add to the sell pressure if it goes further down.I don't day trade anyway, so as long as the line continues upwards in the long run I will be happy.; What would be your prediction for a low price if your technical analysis is right? Looks like about 1200yuan, so $193 or so?I have to say though breaking through the support levels isn't great news, but it could just as well mean that it is oversold and due to rise..I don't really put a lot of faith into technical analysis, I always think it is used after something has happened to explain why it happened in retrospect.You should definitely share your thoughts there.@OP: Here in this topic we discuss why applying TA to Bitcoin does not always work: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=998939.0"
9,1001698,3/25/2015,"Yes thanks I posted there; By looking at the bid sum I doubt the recent $150 bottom will hold, so my guess would be high double digits like $75-$85, something like that.so you think the price should back to $350, recently ////right now the price is low, because there are only whales playing with the market, no new money influx...it could just be the calm before the storm, the problem is that everyone still compare current situation to the 1200 peak, that peak was just pure manipulation(willy bot ecc...) and a bit of luckLooking at last time the price broke down through the resistance levels, it fell to an equivilent of about $190.; If we reach that level (i don't think we will) I will be buying in strongly.So completely off all of your charts?; That doesn't really seem like technical analysis, rather opinion...the funny part of it: just watch how quickly market sentiment turns right back around. it's fucking nuts. perhaps measured in hours.The power (and weakness) of TA is that it is a self-fulfilling prophecy: whenever enough traders see the same lines, they will trade on them, and thus everything with happen as forecast. Up to a black swan event.TA does not always work in general.The market is so weak it didn't even bulltrap to $340-$360, it just stopped at $300, lolRyNinDaCleM recently posted a chart that shows this:It's not off the charts. If the next crash has a similar magnitude than the other ones it means it will end up at high double digits like $75-$85.I have to say, I didn't realise that you were predicting the price for November, do you not think maybe that fundamentals might come into play over such a long time period? Or do you think that the market only works on a technical level, regardless of what happens with regulations, companies accepting bitcoins, ETFs etc? Your trend lines hardly ever touch the curve!; That is also a completely different graph to the one you showed in the first post, where it showed that last time the resistance was broken, there was a flash crash to 933 yuan, before a recovery back to the resistance levels. Using this new graph you seem to be saying that the price will rise to about $400.TA is just a (semi-worthless) tool. The Bitcoin economy will eventually drive the market to amazing new highs.I think it's difficult to draw those very long term trend-lines. If you've off by a few USD, you may miss the price by 50 USD when extrapolating the price into the future. I think leveraged trading has changed Bitcoin with this bubble cycle.In the end market was so weak that it never recahed $330 or $360.Few weeks back I admitted that price could reach $330 using a similar trend line but said that overall was still bearish (like the RyNinDaCleM chart): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=274613.msg10631905#msg10631905Yes following that chart price was supposed to touch $360. Yes is a different chart but it was just to show that ranges in high double digits are not ""off the charts"".""Curve""? What do you mean?Are you really using Bitstamp bid sum in your arguments here?; The market has moved on.; It's time to update your data.It's just an example dude, go to coinsight.org and check for yourself if the situation at any exchange is any different.TA is what it is. Rpietila was dropping TA lines drawing 1 million dollars by now. The thing is we DONT KNOW. What WE KNOW is Bitcoin is amazing and unmatched, and that we are still a extremely underground community.Only then, it would have a solid foundation or something similar as a financial event. Anyways, yeah the reality of the markets are being rough overall though. I just hope those winkelvoss twins can pull something through like ETF or some shit so normal investors can buy a ton to boost it up lol. Maybe some good PR will do the trick, and have faith in the coin. lol. Hurry, someone post twitch recently adopting a tipping service used with bitcoin. post it on reddit! I need some $40 manipulation to sell off my coin.; The btc needs a progress report on all the years event, to get back to $300 or something.Yeah but that's not really how TA should be used, that's more whishful thinking; Ponzietila; I am rather surprised that after all the new merchant adoption and the increased popularity of bitcoin, the price has been falling. No one compares the price to the 1200 mark, everyone mostly compares to the 2014 stable price of 600 , and the drop which has happened since then. It is surprising but it goes to show you just how much money 4 billion dollars actually is. I personally would think there should be no problem in BTC sustaining a multi billion dollar market cap, but that is clearly not the case. A billion is a thousand million and there just simply aren't that many people on this planet willing to gamble or use this cutting edge notion of a currency. This price action now? This is Candyland in comparison.Anyone scared about the current market conditions should go back and read some threads from before the late 2013 run. ;Read some threads after the $266 previous ATH and subsequent Gox and price crash - and even that wasn't close to 2012.2013 saw under $100m of VC investments, and then in 2014 that tripled to up over $300m. ;Now in just a quarter of 2015 we've seen another $200m coming in. ;It's not money that instantly translates to stronger ecosystem, but it definitely will in the future. ;It's also money from people and groups who then have a vested interest in BTC's economy. ;Their investments would perform better with a bigger market cap.I wouldn't even call 2014's $600 as stable - we went from $100 at the end of 2013 up to $1100 in the course of a few weeks driven almost entirely on speculation. ;The ecosystem wasn't close to ready to support that sort of value and every bit of 2014's price action was the correction back down from that ATH. ;At the time it appeared to be stable, but hindsight seems to paint a clearer picture.Bid sum was clearly increasing (and was a lot higher) in 2013 at the end of the bear market and during the bubbles (I posted the mtgox bid sum all throughout 2013 in another thread). My first post shows that right now the opposite is happening. At least for now.But now price and marketcap are exponentially higher which means that exponentially more fresh fiat coming in everyday is needed to support current prices or to spark rallies like in the past.;  Bid sum is the best indicator of incoming greater fools."
10,1001698,3/26/2015,"As for the market cap, in October 2013 it was $2.5B.; Today it's ~$3.5B.; Again, this reflective of linear growth - not exponential.; We're looking at a total market cap that is ~17x just the amount of money that's been dumped into BTC VC in the first quarter of this year alone.; That's one major reason why this isn't as remotely as scary as 2013 was, even when it would have taken less fiat to drive the price higher. Er... ""exponential""?; Saying that we need ""exponentially"" more fresh fiat to support the current price or spark rallies is 100% false - at least since 2012 when the last reward halving occurred.; Since that point there's been 3600 new BTC mined every day.; That means that the new money needed daily that had to come in during both the 30->260 and 100->1100 bubbles was the same.etc.3600 BTC when price is at $1000 ---> $3.6M USD3600 BTC when price is at $10 ; ---> $36'000 USDNo.Patience my fellow bitcoiners. Even I don't like this but we still have a yearly inflation rate of 9.4% once we hit 14m coins next week. Only the mid-2016 halving will bring this downward pressure to an end. The inflation schedule is under appreciated by the public but the distribution mechanism is in full effect as volatility disperses coins. Even the protocol is in a fight at the moment as we have yet to remove the 1MB cap. The fight continues in bitcoin land.Whatever happens, there's always good and bad. I believe bitcoin will never catapult upwards as long as it haven't really found the bottom level. And if it needs to then let it be. I'm preparing to buy at every single dip and I mean getting at a bargain price. Similarly if it just continue to rise and rise, then there shouldn't be any problem here. I think the beginning of next week might be interesting. I can see a dump to lower 200's / high 100's happening."
11,1001698,3/27/2015,"Current market conditions are scary = time to buyMe on the other hand. I'm terrified, but still buying like a fully committed bag holder!WFN find everything scary. Even when he was bullish he never really believed it "
12,1002241,3/25/2015,"It might come back to 260 sometime later this week. Again.. just a personal thought. I'm not a predictor..Will we continue to fall? Or there will be a sudden rise? I personally dont think Bitcoin will drop back to 100 again. Just my personal thought, nothing else.We was at 260 yesterday and suddenly around six PM (GMT+8) the price drop to 250 range. Just a while back, it was 240 and not it is 230.If it falls under 215 then it getz scary. Now, it's in the limits yet.Lately BTC price seems to fluctuate between 230 and 280 /approx.I'd say there is a better chance that it falls below 200.; Most trendlines have been broken.i see nice profit for whom sold at 260, i should've shorted also, i didn't know it could crash in this wayWhat you said is a nice representation of the crowd psychology we have here. You regret not shorting and probably hold the coins thinking if you should join the dump. It's people like you who are now selling in this second wave. Going back to a price from a month ago is not a crash. If we go below the January low then yes it will look bad, but people will look for profit much earlier. Those who are selling now are shorting just like you said and not getting out of Bitcoin. This means they will look for an opportunity to buy back. it's a nice opportunity to buy some extra coins at current price.i think the bottom is at $200 and won't go below that. smart traders can make a decent profit these days.I sold some at 266$ and 282$, but honestly I didn't know this crash became big, I thought it was a 10 or 20 dollars correction, anyways I'm confused about what we're going now.I bought about a dozen at 260. pretty sad right now.Dont worry, Bitcoin is getting more and more popular everyday. This mean that Bitcoin wont staty at 230 for long. It will reach 300 pretty soon.$300 is all i ask;  fingers crossedNah.. $1000 before 2016 is what I ask.. I know what it feels. Just wait for sometime maybe it will go back to 260 again..You have a good chance to sell on profit soon, if the trend of past 2 months is kept.Just imagine how they feel the ones that bought at 6-700$...I try not to concern myself too much with the price as it always dissapoints me but I don't get how it can fall so much in a short period of time. It never makes sense. I was happy for it to go back up to around 200GBP a week ago but now it is at 160.That latest price drop was caused by hacking of that small china altcoin exchange market. Hackers did not steal much ( something like 15 BTC total) but I fear that human mentality and domino effect caused this drop. There is nothing to worry about as soon bitcoin will resume its way to $300 threshold.i doubt 15 btc can drop the price by $50, must be something else, some whales got nervous and dumped something on multiple exchange, right now it's whales war i believeWell if only I knew the answer to that question. I expected the price to cross 300 level but it just fell unexpectedly and now looks like it is still on the downtrend. But one thing I always told myself is to buy when opportunity comes at the right price and continue to hold on to it long term. I expect things will change in years to come but definitely not now. I'm thinking they stole more than 15 BTC...We need real people, tons of them getting in Bitcoin, it's the only way to stop the whales playing around with their big stacks of BTC manipulating the price. The more volume the harder for them it will be.Here more information about that phrase : https://critiqueofcrisistheory.wordpress.com/money-as-a-means-of-payment/It is normal, if the whales don't buy the price will go down .... we name it pump & dump (P&D). Don't worry when all the speculation will end the price will be more stationary and we can't start use bitcoin as ""currency"" : Money as a Means of Payment.If you want a huge significant change, you need everyone to drop what they are currently using now and say its way better because ""blah blah"" and you save 30% in fees or something to worth mention about. And still there is no price volume increase or anything. As for the btc whales manipulating the price, yeah at a certain extent but the price can be done by its operator alone. Yeah, but how do you execute that? I mean you notice recent huge events like Twitch allowing bitcoin being used as a tipping service.If this is the liquidity needed for one to start an exchange I could run a thing like that from my phone. ;If these are the only addresses that were used by the hacker it means Cryptoine had only 5BTC in their hot wallet. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1001408.0Not according to this thread.Oh sorry, I misread and thought we were talking about the Evo coins.; Agreed, this one seems much more minor."
13,1002241,3/26/2015,y..So the downtrend was caused by a exchange market. I just know this news yerterdat
14,1002241,3/30/2015,Rocket refuelling.. /calm before the storm you can do as your wishes just when the price is over $180.; 
15,1002332,3/25/2015,"If yes, when?someone pull this thread back up in 2020 for a good laugh.no one know when, we presume with the next block halving, but it could be early or after that, or never...many newbies will not ever buy at current price, let alone at higher priceBut i hope soI don't think so!Sometimes if something is given freely it has no value, but when the price goes up they take it more seriously.When I first happened upon Bitcoin I was immediately hooked, and tried to sell the idea to anyone who would listen.; I didn't have much success so I shut up about it.; When the GOX climb began they got interested and wanted in at any price.; Two of them came to see me clutching FIAT in their hands, all but begging me to get in on the deal (this was near ATH). I don't get if you are implying price will be 1,000,000 or 0Neither. It'll probably be something like $56,342.54I don't think.I think it will. If it does I can buy a house finallyBut I think it's right time to buy, I think..I don't think it's gonna happen in this and next year.. The chart is scary right now, maybe because of ponzi trends?I think that it will go up higher than that eventually if it catches on. If it catches on after the block halving the price will be higher because miners will need to raise the price to stay profitable. I think that in the future the bitcoin price is going to be highly related to the cost of electricity that will be required to mine them because it is the only thing that can be quantified that is related to mining them.I guess we will. I mean you've seen how the bears love to trade the bear market now. If this thing turns into a bull market the smart bears will turn to bulls and push the price up, just like they're pushing it down these days. I guess it'll still be this year!This right here.; Although I'm thinking this long of a bear market won't be easy to shake off into a crazy rally quickly.; We might see it this year but I'm looking more towards 2016.; Will be happy to be wrong and see it earlier though!No of course, or at least not 'now' maybe after the next halving (but I am not sure).maybe a loaf of bread will cost 37459694839484.38 $let's see what will happen..It might exceed 1k+ $ or might be down to 0.00XX $; >.<;not sure about it.Im saving bookmarks in a special folder called ""bump this 10 years from now"" so I can have a good laugh while I enjoy my extremely strong purchasing power of BTC.Unfortunately, no one is going to manipulate bitcoin to new all time highs, so new holders will be minimal, and there will never be a 1200, or new ath again. ;The time for that to happen and be coordinated has past: microsoft, coinbase launch, whatever etf launched already. ;If those events couldn't save btc price, what event will? ;How do you expect anyone to give you an answer? A month before it hit $1k, no one here would have bet any substantial amount of bitcoins that Btc/usd rates would hit $1000 in 30 days time. As for the fake value $1,200. I would say any btc exchange can do it short term, by making phantom deposits and follow similar to mt.gox events.If not, they wont bother to adapt a new thing. Unless its like added as a dual option on a credit card or something. Its basically dependent on a user base scale, so the true value still stay at that rate only if a huge financial event occurs. That means everyone currently using their credit cards to decide its actually way better and they see a difference.The day my mom starts using it. ;Er... I'm guessing the day moms start using it the value will be well over $1200.maybe but its so hard price back to 1200 again"
16,1002332,3/26/2015,"I'll never doubt any numbers other folks have, like us going to $2k in 2016 or what not.We may have to wait for the next block halving to see some trendRight now, it seems to be stabilizing around $250.; It is going to take a long time.cheersbut it seams so artificial lately that very well anything could happen (for 1200$ next year i doubt it)a shakedown in form of a long beartrap. If the pre-halving pump happens , and i believe it will, then i guess its possible for price to rise to ~600$,Yeah, i believe so too, but it isnt that long until halving anyways. I believe the downtrend should stop (has stopped), and this is just some sort ofBTC-Bank. Kind Regards,In my personal opinion Bitcoin have to give a lot more and we are still on the start of it. There are a lot of countries around the world which is unknown yet and as many more people, companies involved, advertise it and use it for what is build for will make it more popular and the demand it will be increased.It will break this amount for fan.I dont know if it will be this year but i beleive it will be soon.As said this is only my opinion be well everyone!(think about it)Once tomorrow comes.not anytime soon for surePossibly IF bitcoin makes an ETF onto the US stock exchange or china accept BTC. short of that I doubt it. Best we can hope for is a rise and stabilization around $500With all the capital flowing into startups recently and the foundation being laid for institutional money to enter, I think this is how the market will play out. Unless scalability/regulation is too much of an issue and something better replaces btc. But, I really dont think it`ll hit $1,200 anytime soon if anything I feel like its going the opposite direction. Only because I dont see any great financial events outside from a PR article from coindesk mentioning about twitch using it as a tipping service, which grows the userbase. For those who bought bitcoin back in 2012 at $200, yeah now its back giving us a 2nd chance in my view.I swear we all hit a reset button, for those who got into bitcoin less then $100; congrats. We'll only know that a killer app is out when it comes out, it's pretty much a binary thing. Either it's out, and bitcoin explodes, or it isn't. It won't be a gradual thing. So just because you don't hear any news now, it doesn't mean anything. By the time you heard the news, it will be too late. The problem with this kind of thinking is, news doesn't go like ""we are 5.6% towards completing a killer app for bitcoin"" then ""we are 8.34% finished with developing another killer use case for bitcoin"".If yes, then I would be rich, lolIt all depends on the market, that many who buy bitcoin market in large numbers, I think there is a possibility of bitcoin can achieve such a price back.For the moment no one can predict whether bitcoin will be able to return to the figure $ 1.200also don't get people that say this. 1200 is only about 5x the current price, so you'll get a 4x profit. Chances are, you don't have everything in bitcoin, or even the majority of your net worth in bitcoin. So at most bitcoin going to 1200 might increase your networth by 50 or 100%. If increasing by 50 or 100% will make you rich, you're probably already kind of rich. In this case I think everything can happen, even though it will not be as smooth as what has been thought, same as well as when bitcoin reached the price of $ 1.200Is bitcoin price now is the ideal price for bitcoin price?The moment world financial markets start to really crash, that is the moment of Bitcoin rise. Merchant and consumer adoption won't help much, only crysis. And it will happen soon.Making people believe in bitcoin of all the risks is important for people to buy bitcoin. And this is one of the main factors that will increase the value of buy bitcoinIs this the same as when at the end of 2013 at the time of bitcoin reached the highest price?"

18,1002332,3/28/2015,"Maybe the winklevoss Gemeni exchange will have a positive effect on BTC's price?but let's not get excited too early. i hope they will open their doors within a few months.i hope so. i have been reading about it and it is indeed something that can give bitcoin a huge boost.Better sell your coins now if you're not convinced of this technology! I will never understand the sense of threads like this.Stop whining man! If you just went in to make a quick buck and running after your fiat cash I have to disappoint you!As long as it isn't a peak like last time, we will be just fine. We don't want it to drop hard for another time.If Bitcoin grows with 100% each year from now, which is a reasonable estimate, then we might actually stay above $1000.It might take a year or 3-5 to reach over $1200 level again. At least I don't expect it before 2018.I'm thinking something significant will happen to force the price upwards at some point this year and it'll be well on its way upward before most even know what is going on. People have forgotten how insane this market can be when it wants to change.My initial assessment was that the rapid fall to 160 was the bottom and we will go up slowly with a rally either this year end or next year. It looks now that there is a real chance it may go below 200 and even to low 100s. In that case not so sure about the future, 1200 might take years."
19,1002332,3/29/2015,"Yeah, before fixating on huge prices in the future, the first question should be along the lines of ""when will Bitcoin stop falling?""Yes.; When Willybot 2.0 is online.Just think of all the things in down the pike that will bring in demand to buy coins and if there's enough or any of that then the future is bright. I presume the bulls are accumulating in the mean time and then planning a time for when the breakout makes sense so that it'll go on generically. I am one who has forgot the insanity that this market can bring i have actually found it quite boring recently. OP i think we will see it again but not any time soon and i believe if it comes it will be legit so will be exciting times.Hopefully this is the case but we have seen some good news recently that should have raised the price and it is still the stuck, which i might add is not a big deal to me because i have time to get some more end of the month. So there is no warranty about price rises with Gemini. Coinbase exchange had no effect on prices.we are at 230 for two months nowit's not falling anymore, we are at 230 rock solid, we didn't fall back to 180, it just that we retuned to a previous value, i dom't want to call this a fallSeeing that, it sure is possible BTC could follow the same fate.; It could take decades.; Take at the max chart of the Nikkei.; http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5En225+interactive#%7B%22range%22%3A%22max%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%22linear%22%7D"
20,1002332,3/30/2015,"How often do we have a revolutionary design like bitcoin come around though? also as been said before its only going to take a few years for bitcoin to develop to its full potential. ;Either way im hodling.By all means, hold.The blockchain is revolutionary, yes.; But this is also the open market and btc is traded in that market.; ;Bitcoin is here for the first time there is nothing you or anyone else can do to sway that, especially someone who asked if that is a good idea to short at 240; They could not be further apart you can't compare the 2 except they can be brought and sold you may as well plucked up a random graph or is that what you done.I fail to say how you can compare that chart with Bitcoins can you explain how you feel that it could share the same fate so that might help me understand what you mean by this? I see nothing that could give you that idea http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225 Edit:; And yup, I asked if shorting from 240 is good.; Why...?; Cos it's possible it could go down under 200.And do not forget the primary catalyst for btc's surge at the end of 2013 was due to price manipulation via Willybot.That example with the Nikkei is given a lot in trend following lectures as it shows that anything is possible in an open market. ;So there's certainly that possibility that bitcoin could stay under 300usd for longer than we think.You're right. ;You know better. ;To keep on topic i think we will eventually see 1200 and above we just don't know when. Anyway good luck.That is my point if you was going to ask to short maybe you're asking at the wrong time and should have enough experience to know it would have been a good time a few weeks ago.That is sweet so now it is possible to go below 200 when it was not when it was 300? Never said we could not stay below 300, i remember why we had the last bubble pump not disputing that or was i, nope.Of course anything is possible but you don't just pull random graphs from where ever you pulled it from ;Never said i was right and i know better just that you was wrong there is a big difference. Above ATH is a FACT, we'll get there, if you don't have this mentality you don't fully get bitcoin and have no notions of what long term holding is.I'm not talking about over the last month, I'm talking about ever since peaking at $1200; since then it's been a pretty steady grind downwards, with several small junps upward that turned out to not be sustained. But, if say 3 months from now, Bitcoin hasn't fallen further, and in fact has made a move uo that it can hold onto, whether it's to $350 or $400, then we can start fixating on future price rises. But right now, it's if much greater importance for Bitcoin to lock into a stable price zone for an extended period (read:longer than a few weeks) than to speculate when it will actually grow to bigger values. I will not bet on it. Its at a balance point, but I feel the probability of an upside is less than a fall. Very difficult to say at this point but do not take this staying above 230 for now as a bullish sign. 2016, when we'll be nearing the block reward halving should start another bullrun...I expect 2015 to give the price a slow recovery (though it might first continue dropping in the coming weeks)my crystal ball says 2yrs."
21,1002332,3/31/2015,"And again let me emphasize... ;Bitcoin's surge to 1200 was primarily caused by the Willybot manipulating the price.; That's why it went up so quick.That said, it is possible that it could take decades before bitcoin can see it's peak of 1200 again. ;Why...? ;You said it yourself... ""To keep on topic i think we will eventually see 1200 and above we just don't know when.""Exactly the point of showing you that Nikkei graph. ;It's been decades since it saw its peak, and it's even backed by the Japanese economy... a real economy with regulations and big investors.""We don't know when.""Way the current price rates are showing consistency in terms of keeping a low profile, I am not seeing any high value like that, unless wall street gets a hang of the bitcoin as some of the recent news are suggesting, then we might see some spike.Unlike last two times, the advance was mainly caused by technology advancement, the next wave will be driven by combined mining technology improvement and credit expansion when bitcoin can be mortgaged through ETF I have a feeling that when everyone is ready, the next wave will be much larger than the previous two wave. ;When daily coin supply becomes less and less, and the capital in the play is getting larger and larger, a fireworks party is approachingMuch faster than you can imagineNo necessarily. Although that had potential back then, even though we do not know exactly what happened. Indeed. We should start seeing price movements in late 2015, or early 2016, just before the halving. If the ETF pops up in the meantime, we should definitely see it. Who knows where the price will stop at though. We should just be patient as always.or it may not be so public at 1st, it would be in on sites like this https://sharespost.com/private-market-insights/sharespost-100-list/So companies like Coinbase for example, would effect traditional investors thus having more skin in the game for price movement.It wouldnt be facebook obviously, but I`m referring to companies such as SF location esp silicon valley raising funds then selling out at IPO is old news.I say if the ETF doesnt happen, I would see similar to how facebook went public on got more public funds.... Not that I would mind it happening again. ;. I hope it does.True. ;We do not know exactly. ;It's a good idea that we should because there was clearly ;price manipulation that went on at the end of 2013. ;It was somethng that would set alarm bells if the SEC were regulating cryptos. ;i'm starting to think that we need the block halving to have some breathwell what you say it could be true, but i'm confident that we are aiming high now or we are just stuck there at 230, i'm fairly sure that it won't fall back under 200 anymoreWe'll see. ;But it doesn't matter what you think will happen because there's a huge chance you can be wrong, no one can predict the market. ;The more important thing is knowing what to do when the price reaches a certain level. ;Who cares what you think. ;Just plan ahead.The price is being manipulated, so nothing should surprise us there. Bitcoin is volatile as ever. The times are hard for bitcoin, with media focusing on the bad, markets being manipulated, the upcoming fork and such. Hopefully everything ends up as supposed to.It's all speculation and theory. That's why we should stop acting smart, because we won't know what happened. We should focus on the future, rather than remember the dark times of Mt.Gox. better than who just say ""hey guy i predict it fall to zero tomorrow, goodbye"", that's plain stupidit's not just ""what i'm think"" it's about following what it is happened and happening, 230 is holding strong since months already, based on that i have written that claimI would not be surprised to see it gain even higher than 1200 USD either as a result to a bubble or legitimately, either way seems plausible to mewell, I can agree on the part that the next up wave may take us beyond ATH. But it will take a longer while IMO. I see 2015 as a consolidation and base building. Only if we are close enough to the next halving and have enough positive developments (e.g., ETF), we may start another panic buying (mania) phase. But we are far from there for now.yes we will before 2016 end"
22,1002332,4/1/2015,"True.; Just pointing out that a parabolic move late 2013 was manipulated rather than the market finding bitcoin's true value.; The crypto-scene has no regulatory body looking out for it.; Today! Check out charts, it is almost there!I guess the next time we might see less manipulation, if a rise comes. At least we will be producing less Bitcoin after 2016.Indeed. Although there is no real evidence one could easily say that it was. The spike was just too high. These days nothing surprises me.I think bitcoin may one day see over 1200 USD again. Who knows when though.. Maybe in mid 2016?Why you so sure then not after the 2016 end?"
23,1002332,4/2/2015,Who knows. For now it seems that this bear market is nowhere near its end. More than likely it will go below 200$ once again this year and stay there for a decent period of time.
24,1002332,4/3/2015,"Could be, but I actually have a feeling that we may not go as high as everyone is suspecting. I hear people speculating about going north of $5'000... I think that's impossible to achieve with the next wave. But it may be battered-bull syndrome on my side "
25,1002332,4/4/2015,Willybot 2.0 will take btc to 5000 and beyond.
26,1002332,4/5/2015,"Some time next year.Predictions have a very high chance of being wrong. I'm hoping though that there will be a positive trend soon. It's either up to the ETF or block halving. We can't really know. There was a lot of speculation in this subforum and even in the one for newbies. A lot of people had anticipated much higher prices in the past and even now.both of the events you mentioned are to happen next year. A lot of people here, myself included, is speculating it may push the price up significantly. The bigger will be the deception if that doesn't happen.Indeed. You're definitely right about it. If everyone expects a lot, and nothing big happens that could cause a turmoil. The price could actually either go down or go up but only a little. Are you sure about the ETF? We've been waiting for it for quite some time now. I mean it is bound to happen. What are the chances of that happening this year?If you look at the multi-year price trend (i.e. edit it out the spikes and look for a baseline), it's already perhaps a little higher than where it should be (not that markets are known for being rational), but if we get get out of the mode of thinking of winning the lottery every 6 months, and see it as a standard investment, then it's providing very solid returns based on it's evolution, which are way above inflation.; For all it's volatility, there aren't that many investments available to average Joe that we can say that about.I think the halving might have more effect than the other events we're watching, maybe starting a couple of months before, as people get a feel for what the price could be climbing 'from', rather than guessing too far into the future.A chunk of that may already be priced in, and we get a disappointing fizzle when they actually occur."
27,1002332,3/1/2017,"No, I can't see it happeningI think recent price is new record of bitcoin achievement. Because more than $1200 is very big amount for bitcoin; You can see your wallet, especially blockchain.info the bitcoin price of about 1216 dollars. Although I know the price of bitcoin in the wallet and in each trading platforms is different, but I'm sure the differences are not too flashy.I dont think that more then $1200 is bigger amount for bitcoin as their is no valuation of bitcoin price as much the success and acceptance is going to happen that much high price it is going to touch so no higher price is big amount for bitcoin but ya it may be higher for bitcoiners who are using it"
28,1002332,3/2/2017,but if you are getting it from some third party service such as the wallet you mentioned it can be an average price and also with some delay so you should always expect some kind of difference. it depends on where you are getting your price from. if you are getting it directly from an exchange API service then it is live and the current reliable price of that exchange service which is mostly the same on top exchanges.
29,1002341,3/25/2015,"But those who don't believe in BTC, it's just bullshit nonsense fantasythose who believe in BTC, they think it's precious and will rise again.it's also like christianity in that if you're into it, there's a decent chance that you're fuckin' obsessed with it and think it will determine your future. and ppl will want to stay well away from you, since you're obsessed about something they've practically never heard of. and you'll just think they're beartards.Just keep use your own currency, I had a reason to use BTC so that why I use it.If you hate BTC so much, why just keep quiet? Let us choose your own way, I didn't even bother with your way.I'm a Christian, but I always let that slide because your argument isn't worth my time. Especially you compared the Bible with Bitcoin, like comparing apple to orange. Made no sense imhoThe cold hard truth is, that financially, bitcoin is a gimmick. For it to be used as store of value, it's too unstable, and for transfer of value, it's too inconvenient. So, practicality won't give it value and the only thing left to give it value is belief that it has value. And if something is this much dependent on belief, then there's no surprise that recognizable religious patterns will emerge.To the bitcoin fanatics, there is no room for doubt on Satoshis words. If you have doubt, then the fanatics will tell you that you have to read the white paper again, and again, and again, until you finally realize the same truth as they see. Quite similar to religious fanatics.I think that the mentality of the bitcoin community is very similar with the mentality of religious groups and Satoshi's white paper is like the bible, both full of dogmas.Well I try not to connect it to religion. Whatever I believe in about the future of bitcoin, I have my reasons for it and same goes for those non-believers. Each of us have our own rights to our own option and I won't criticize others just because their opinions are not aligned with mine. However, one thing I would like to point out is that I'm not in total obsession. Bitcoin do have its own weaknesses.bitcoin believers are like christians, in that the vast majority never read the white paper (or the bible). And the majority of those who did probably don't fully understand it. also when you explain it to average joe, they think you are brain washed somethingwholething is about faith that network will survive and spread all over the worldIt's quite similar in that you have to be faithful BUT when I am shorting, I feel like this BTC wholething is virtual bullshit.It's just when I am long, I am hyped as fuck, I dont hate BTC, I trade BTC daily,Maybe you mean like the followers are cult like, that I can understand, but you don't say that Bitcoin is focussing on disrupting the status quo, but the bible wishes to protect and rely on the status quo, your comparison makes absoltely no sense....I am pretty sure Jesus and Christian thing was pretty disruptive to Roman empire at that time~^That. In the bible book everyone pays with bitcoin.Fixed that for you. Cryptography and mathematics are not about belief, but about observation. But those who don't believe in don't understand the unavoidable consequences of this innovation, think it's just bullshit nonsense fantasy""at the time"", we're in 2015 now, and you can't deny that it is protecting and relying on the status quo The fact I can send a million dollars through skype by exchanging QR codes with a smartphone bypassing endless fees and limitations is indeed a FACT.A man dying and then resurrecting flying up the sky as the prophet of God is nonsense fantasy.And those who hoard BTCeanie BTCabies Bitcoin are the real rebels?A two-thousand-year-old book about a poor d00d who scorned wealth & called all earthly authority bullshit is ""protecting and relying on the status quo""?Nope, BTC ain't a bible book, it would rather make sense if you compared it with the NY Stock Exchange.FTFYbuy, hold and take them to the grave with you in a brain wallet!i definitely read it ONLY like the bibleThe End.Bitcoin gets nailed to a cross.The Satoshi Holy Bible:"

We are the Big Bang (assuming that there was such an event). According to that, we must govern ourselves instead of letting someone to govern us. Bitcoin --- being decentralized --- ideally fits into this way of thinking. This is it, bros, block chain is the new paradigm not only in computer science but in religion too! It's a proof of concept that we can live without rulers.Christianity and Islam have done a ""great"" job making everyone believe that we have been created by something or someone. If we have been created then there must be a supreme creator, right? We came to this world by the hands of the supreme creator and we must be humble and thankful for it.

33,1002482,3/25/2015,"Do you think this is enough to turn the tides around?Earlier this year, business after business and merchants after merchants are learning to accept bitcoin.With last year's bitcoin roller coaster ride, do you think bitcoin has what it takes to bounce back?http://bitforum.info/t/will-bitcoin-bounceback-this-year/659Will Bitcoin Bounceback This Year?Let just hope Atleast that mean more traders will accept bitcoin soon so I be able to buy more stuff then!Looking back at ""cloud mining"" and ponzis trends, that still would be the sidedown of bitcoin.Mmm... Maybe just bumb a little? Back around $300~$500?I think business accepting it is a good way for it to hit the mainstream because it informs more people about it. But for it to really hit the big time business need to be holding bitcoin and setting prices in bitcoin that don't fluctuate based on the exchange rate this will drive a more stable price. I know it might not seem like good business to do this but it is what is needed for it to be a stable and accepted currency. Is 2015 the year? I don't know that is for the community to decide if it is time.MeOn the other hand, I could be wrong. Often am. I don't know anything about stock markets / investments / highs and lows / futures / whatever, but I have a feeling that by the time bitcoin stabilizes, it'll be significantly lower than most predictions. Maybe $100-200? It's hard for me to see 1BTC @ $50,000 USD (as I've read in the past from hopeful enthusiasts). Actual BTC price will be stable. This is the last year for us peasants to get as much BTC as possible while its affordable to buy entire units of BTC.This year is a year of venture capital money flowing in like crazy, just look at the facts. There are graphs that show this. 2015 is the year with the biggest pump in VC money so far.I think the same was sort of true in 2014 but did not lead to the rise in the price of bitcoin then. I would hope for a stable price than a pump. Just because merchants are starting to accept bitcoin doesn't mean the price will go up or the bitcoin adoption will increase. I think it will rise in price quite a bit by the end of this year, but it will never reach the $1000 it once was.As you said, at a certain point we'll find a stable price, and then all of that news from 2014/early 2015, and VC money along with Wall Street stepping in will be quite ready for the next phase of the market. ;Once there's little profit to be made from dumping and shorting, there's only one direction to go.Also keep in mind 2014's price action was largely a downtrend as part of a correction from the crazy bubble that pushed BTC from $100 -> $1100. ;The price was influenced very heavily by speculation, and it still is.In 2015, we've already seen close to $200 million, and that was before the end of the first quarter. ;The rate of money coming in this year is quite a bit faster.; There was a lot of positive news, but most of it was news suggesting things to come (and we still haven't seen them yet, but they're on the horizon) it wasn't enough to stem the tide of a necessary correction.2014, at $314 million, more than tripled what 2013 did. ;http://www.coindesk.com/venture-capital-funding-bitcoin-startups-triples-2014/The same was not quite true over the whole of 2014. ;2014 saw lots of good news, but in terms of VC capital, 2015 looks to be off to a far stronger start.*You scammed all your loyal believers, you deserved that painful death you received, now rot in hell you bastard.*BTC RxIxP 2015 - i think it will go to $400 at most. i'm already happy if we maintain $300 this year.$1000 definitely won't happen this year. i don't even think next year. it will need to be a stable rise.At some point when the new ETF and exchanges start opening up for business and as wealthy onlookers and hedge funds start coming on board, the amount of new money that comes in won't just come in in a small and steady fashion. There'll be massive green candles coming and the price jumps will be huge. And, that's just the diagnosis w/o the remittances, e-commerce, precious metals holders coming in. It's most likely gonna blow the doors off this thing and be an incomprehensible rise that will make history going forward. People are so down in the dumps right now that they either forget what happens during bull markets or are new and can't conceive of such a situation happening.I dont see the ETF being passed anytime soon, as for their other new exchanges to open, thats something actually more tangible since they blew like a couple million into it already.Wait how do you know if an ETF is actually going to happen? Did the twins actually pull through with SEC? this conversation started back in 2012 when buttferfly labs was still a leading market for most asic miners. 2015 target: 17 777$ per bitcoinUntil then, strap in or get off the bus because it's going to be a bumpy ride both ways.That said, we are more stable than 2013 because the the market has better price discovery mechanisms: futures, leveraged long/shorts, skilled traders to take on whales, and more liquidity. Bitcoin will only be ""stable"" relative to current capital markets in 5-10 years, when its market cap is much higher and has millions more in liquidity on either side of the orderbooks. At that point, we may be trading in bits. You are right, Chef. This market being so thinly traded that any sort of big move cuts like a hot knife through butter. There simply isn't enough liquidity on either side to stop it and big moves snowball as traders all pile on.seems nice  and everyone becomes a millionaire You would only need 56.25246105 bitcoins to be a millionaire.with BTC at 17777, it's market cap would be ~259.5 bil (with ~14.6-14.7 coins by the end of the year) and implied market cap (based on 21 mil coin)-$373 bil-a size of Google or 1/2 of Apple. maybe in the alternative universe...but it is OK to contemplate such things(dumb) VC money in the bitcoin space (which is not a lot of money by the way) will suddenly realise that it has invested in a mini dotcom bubble that is collapsing. Everybody will look at bitcoin as the little volatile, irreversible, non scalable joke that nobody uses or needs aside from drug dealers, speculators, gamblers, and libertards.^^^ Yes, and that price will be at low double/single digits, which will take a few years. By that time, everybody will be starting to adopt semi-centralised technologies that work in a similar way as the blockchain to move fiat currencies (like the IBM adept project or others), taking what's useful about this whole crypto movement (a distributed ledger to move any asset/currency around, and smart contracts ) and discarding the unusable bullshit (bitcoin).""As you said, at a certain point we'll find a stable price""Sorry but it goes more like this:I think bitcoin will end 2015 in green  I personally think (and hope) that btc will see 500 USD again this year.They laugh at the current market cap of Bitcoin. Once they start investing heavily in Bitcoin we might all feel like we are early adopters, even if you bought today.It becomes stronger and stronger. As Chef Ramsay stated, we have to wait for wealthy investors who bring in fresh money.In the very early stage of Bitcoin, yes, it's still early, every year is THE year for Bitcoin.Warren Buffet is a decrepid old man. The best investment of all times would have been to register domain names back in the early 90's. Warren Buffet has no idea about technological breakthoroughts because he doesn't know how to use a computer. He's hanging around with Floyd May or not Mayweather those days, enough says.yes, and I'm choosing that alternative universe.he's an old fart who should just shut up and start wrapping up his shit on this planet before he leaves it+1"
34,1002482,3/26/2015,"I think there is an outside possibility that this could come true, but I think there are too many people that have just recently heard about bitcoin and are just waiting with their fingers on the trigger to jump in.cheerseven worse situation than before.and those traders/holder that are interested in sharp rise and volatility are no friends to bitcoin, because they will drop their bags and sell their souls if that brings them profit, and in the end were left withIts even better in the longrun to keep current prices, but to gain more liquidity, so that in cases of big cashing out, that doesnt reflect on price the way its reflecting now. That is the healthiest way for bitcoin to go,I personally doubt that bitcoin will go to a sharp rise, or a bubble within 2015, but rather in the early months of 2016, before the halving, and it will again be mostly driven by speculation.The fact that there are increasing numbers of merchants alone cant rise the price too high alone, but the fact that there is interest in the technology is definetly promising.Get educated as a whale watcher and change your thinking, then you'll know the real secrets to make bank.Anyone who thinks otherwise should get out now!2015 is going to be HUGE for bitcoin and crypto, you wait and see.It takes worldwide financial crysis to be back. Which will happen soon, combined with 2016 BTC halving, I think we will see 10k $ in no time.Don't you think Bitcoin is bigger, more important advancement than Google and Apple (all together). Me I just think like that. Bitcoin is unstoppable.If you ask me, I would say, I don't think so. Whatever the outcome, eventually everything still goes back to the basic supply and demand factor. As long as demand has not catch up, and supply is going to be the same as it is, the price will drown. My only hope is when the halving took place which is suppose to happen some time next year. ;2015 - The year of DASHAnd no.You mean XMR...if we can replicate end 2013 and then with 2016 early 2014, it would be good, but the trend seems uncertain, too many whales playing, and the price is stuck thereWe can't do nothing but wait and watch as we are not major players in the market, we can only hope for the best, and I have big trust on bitcoin being a success."
35,1002482,3/27/2015,"2013 was the year of Bitcoin.Bitcoin is doing fine and if you make the right decisions every year is a good one. As long as Bitcoin exists there's money to be made.Especially if you bought into both pumps (in April and December), traded on Silk Road and used MtGox as your main exchange.; You were here in 2011 bearish on bitcoin when it was 2 dollars. I would imagine you don't want to think about 2011 being the year of bitcoin. You have so much bitterness towards bitcoin (because you had the chance for wild riches and blew it by being cynical) that you will never be taken seriously on this forum Nagle.That is the real reason you are here though right? Or do you post endless negative tripe on other enthusiast fora for other things you think will fail?10,000 other random guys like me buying bitcoins each month are currently enough to buy up the entire mining supply. Next year after the halving that drops to just 5000. The exchange price could be sent back to 1000 for probably as little as twenty million dollars of exchange buying. What is that in the context of 500 million dollars of VC money flooding into the scene in the last year and a half. And you think these guys don't want a return on their money and are 'dumb'? Give us a break. Yet here you are. Every. Single. Day."
36,1002482,3/28/2015,"Only when those of us confident enough about higher prices hold them can the higher price be sustained.As for if I think it will, not really.; We'll see some rallies and some dips, but nothing like the China bubble we had.; Personally, I'd rather have a stable price than have it 'bounce back'.; However, with technologies like Tether coming along, you can still use BTC without actually having to deal with the price swings.; Bitcoin should be seen as more of a tool than a long-term investment IMO.based on this one can suppose that basically every two years bitcoin go BOOM, so next one should be this yeari don't really agree, 2013 wasn't the first time where bitcoin went high, i recall 2011 was the same x20 increase in priceSo there is always a first time.; Until then, people thought Bitcoin always moved up during a calendar year.If I remember right, 2014 was the first year Bitcoin actually went down.depend the news or gossip or something out there about bitcoin, i think its can make increase bitcoin price go up; well, its hard to predict now. but i think bitcoin will go up this year; ...5) China, they love BTC but just need a reason to throw fund into it more acceptingly - government will give up trying to block some day and approve of it.; China itself is in a huge credit bubble that is going to bust eventually as well so people will want to get out of the yuan and into something, BTC will see some growth...5) USA $$$ is due to implode one day.; I mean we are at what $19 trillion in debt, the first rate increase is due finally, the markets should dive somewhat, inflated tech stock values has Silicon Valley in a bubble somewhat again, etc.; Come on...4) Europe is due to implode any day still now - can't prop it up forever.3) Adoption continues at a stead pace as a ""currency.""; This will continue to get interesting as price rises from above.; - We have all these ex-financial exec leads jumping into BTC now, sure the ones that exploded CDOs, etc.; Seems shady a bit but go ahead and ride along.; - COIN true ETF should launch in near future as well.; been very quiet which is a good sign and you would think it'll target around same time or after Gemini.; - Gemini, first ""true regulated USA based exchange"" was supposed to launch in Q1.; you would assume any day now even if late.2) the tons of wall street news just doesn't seem to stop each week now.; it is always the announcement of plans though so when we finally start seeing some launches and action the price should head up - as market cap grows.; if market cap shoots up, price has to as well...1) next week it seems we may see a nice pop when the GBTC quasi-ETF starts seeing some trades finally - the initial puts will demand a BTC price jump back up toward $300 to make sense...Seems like 2015 is starting to look up for a strong rebound or even permanent trend upwards.Quite hard to see it above $2000 by end of this yearHope I'm wrong.I hope so but I don't see it.; Despite lots of good news the price action has all been sideways or down.; Any rallies are met with a fair amount of selling from miners who apparently can just barely cover their costs.; The price of any commodity approaches its extraction cost, and it would seem like we are in a slow period for the price right now.I'm not saying we will see 6 digits, but I wouldn't be surprised if we did.Why not? Nasdaq and nyse are on the sidelines, waiting to throw money at Bitcoin. Next rise could very likely be orders of magnitude bigger than the previous rise. "
37,1002482,3/29/2015,"oh wait... we haven't seen 5 yet.. then 5 will be next.exactly. we've already seen 1,2,3,4 and 5 digits. the next big thing can only be 6 digits. simple logic. easy money.I'm leaning towards this gentleman's prediction. Once the market can be trusted by institutional money, lots of it will come into this space.It is now a question of when the institutional money will flow in. 2014 has been a great year for money flowing into Bitcoin companies. At some point, this will be reflected in the price as well."
38,1002482,3/30/2015,"the same question in 2014; ""Is 2014 The Year?""explosion of price? mass adoption? wall street?every year people say it's the year. and btw, what is considered the year of bitcoin?For Bitcoin to rally, it needs some good news on the development front; or even better, some bad news from the global economic front."
39,1002482,3/31/2015,"we all thought that 2014 was the golden era, but it turned out as the black book for the market in the end. So no predictions on that one. But hoping that price holds a steady price to attract new market.No, 2015 is clearly not the year. It will be the base building and trend reversal year. Important one, but not the one. The real fun will come the next year with ETF, halving and other fireworks.2016 will be the year of bitcoin, when next reward halving happens"
40,1002482,4/1/2015,"but I am a bit optimistic, since its so volatile. I think if anything though, if it does go up to $300ish $400 range, it should be around based on whales making another stab based on the investments they see going on in the bitcoin arena. 2015 seems like everyone back in 2013, where we just said it`ll go higher then $1,000 back then when it was $1,000 due to mt gox.We are going to see tons and tons of people regreting not buying like we ded back in early 2013, then they will blame BTC being too high when they had the opportunity to get it cheap.2015 is buying and accumulation year. it may be boring, but the real fun will be next year.We could potentially see a price surge in 2016 after the halving, or once the ETF goes public. You never know. OP I do not think that this is the year in which we will see the price surge that you expect. This year we will see a lot of development in the infrastructure. Nonsense. Every year people say that. When is the 'buying and using year'. Bitcoin is not a investment, it is a currency. When it begins bitcoin will double in value in a relatively short time frame, say 6-8 weeks to $500. Then it will top off and base some more maybe months to a year (halving) ... OR it will continue to run in a new mania, doubling again to $1000 in a shorter time frame, say 3-4 weeks, at which point the new mania will be fully-blown, it will double again in 2 weeks to 2000 and then to 4-6000 range in a week and then 8-12,000 in a matter of days, before popping and collapsing ... but not below 1200 again.At some point in the near future bitcoin will begin it's next run, basing off the ~$250 mark (interestingly very close to previous ATH before last bubble ~$266 and even closer when viewed in total market cap not price.)And for wall street to come in, I thought they are already were involved. the dumb vc money is still a shit ton of money I mean if you think thats small money then you prob havent seen that in person. The day bitcoins $1 per 1 btc will be some sight to see. the thing with technology you would have to use a source thats already been created. why bother re-create it in a new way? 2015 is the year that will make Bitcoin even stronger then ever before."
41,1002482,4/2/2015,"Indeed you only need to look at venture capital and new services appearning nonstop. The fact the masses hasn't caught on it yet reflects on the price, but its a matter of time."
42,1002482,4/3/2015,"I think it could very well be a year for the price to recover to a certain degree, but I haven't really made up my mind on whether we will achieve a new ATH. Chances of recovering to $1'000 aren't that bleak, though - in my opinion!"
43,1002482,4/4/2015,"I am really hoping BTC will bounce back this year. No one can know for sure, but last year was pretty much bear the whole year. Hopefully this year wont be the same.i could see a steady and very slow rising from nowthis year is a consolidation year for bitcoin, bitcoin will see a strong correction price and a new value will be established without the worry to return to the previous price, 230-250 seems already this value, is holding very goodIt has been mostly driven by speculators so far, and thus, this year seems to be good year to accumulate coins cheaply, ahead of the bitcoin-positive events coming next year, i.e., halving event, ETF, etc.Nonsense. Bitcoin may be seen as an asset, and in fact, it has been seen as an asset by most of it users so far. I'm not even surprised that we have had many people complaining. Don't get me wrong. I'm accumulating as well, but whenever I see something that I need that can be bought with Bitcoin I buy it.That's not even contradicting it was rather supporting. A lot of people do see Bitcoin as an asset. It's mostly because of these 'got rich with Bitcoin' stories. That train is gone.There's no real point in forcing bitcoin to be a currency right now. It can do that when the infrastructure is more mature, and it gets better at doing that. For now, it is good as a speculative asset, and I think the key is to get people to recognize the potential of this technology, rather than to try to force them to subscribe to some political ideology. It's the same for bitcoin. If bitcoin was meant to be a currency, that doesn't mean it works best as a currency. Certainly it doesn't work very well right now, because the infrastructure is not there. I can possibly imagine a day when bitcoin will work well as a currency, but it is far behind fiat in pretty much every single way currently. There's no point having a fast international transfer confirmation when it can't really be used on the other side, or would take days to have it converted back to fiat at some cost. If I had a rice cooker, I could use it to make bread. Just because something is made with a certain purpose in mind, doesn't mean it has to be used for that purpose. It doesn't even necessarily have to remain as the primary purpose.I strongly believe we will (at least) experience the trend reversal this year, which - in my opinion - has already happened in January and it's confirmation happens as we speak!!!The year is 2016 wihtout fbi dumps, with etf and halvingWhat will really make bitcoin succeed are the projects we don't currently know about, projects we currently aren't paying attention to. Who knew that clash of clans will become so popular when it's really just a clone of so many other similar games? We don't really know when something will breakout like that. Or what it will be. Besides, we already know about these things.The effect of ETF/Gemini et al. is greatly overestimated, in my opinion. It's not these things that bring no real benefit to the usability of bitcoins, that bring really no innovation to the field that will catapult bitcoin to mainstream. Not the original intention at all, probably an active perversion, but a very possible outcome. If it arrives then it might well start a tidal wave of others looking to enter. I doubt finance professionals care remotely about the currency aspect, it's all about BTC as an asset class and there's nothing else quite like it out there. I think it'll blow our tits off. And I see 2015, as the year of potential good buys. Meaning, whenever you feel there is more room to the upside, rather than to the downside, there will be speculators buying, hoping to sell it more expensive.That is exactly my point. Bitcoin is a speculative asset for now, until it is not proven otherwise.Haha i like your theory"

Exactly, and usually the trend reversal events are long and boring. So far so good. These organizations create private facilities alone for the stock exchange, so they already been doing it with bitcoin.Search those words in the thread, and see what you find. It links back to a auction won on the silkroad coins etc which is a bit off-topic. But, this is just to give you a insight on whats going on. It is a zero sum game, based on who can inject money at anytime if they wished. Esp, people like ex jp morgan people makes tons of money, and making a secret mining company thats listed as a cucumber mining?This quote is probably what most fear. But, reject it in our minds only because we all love to dream.Arm yourself with wisdom and knowledge or prepare to be taken advantage of.It has already been discussed at length, Bitcoin is NOT a zero sum game (no monetary system is and it is a confusion banksters have used to dupe people out of value for centuries). Gains from comparative efficiency in properties (storage, transaction, security, etc) with respect to other forms of money and value increase by Metcalfe network value (network effect) are two main contributors, and there are others, dyodd.QuoteIt is a zero sum game,"
46,1002482,4/14/2015,It's also generally a good time to buy since the prices are relatively low.
47,1002994,3/25/2015,"I think ordinary people at scared to hold bitcoin themselves for fear it will be stolen or whatever. ;This gives them an easy way to invest now in a format that they're comfortable with.I think silberts etf that's about to hit the market any day is a game changer. ;This opens up a whole new class of investors. ;People could add bitcoin to their 401k for Christ sake to get a little speculative.I'm usually big on technical analysis and it has served me well many many times. ;But any good technical analyst knows that news can jolt an equity out its pattern at any given time.What you are talking about (securing the BTC with a format they are comfortable with) will come with the Winklevoss ETF, if it ever comes.OTCQX moves in average $70 million per YEAR per security.

If a few million old lunatics throw away half a per cent of their retirement funds as a flat out gamble it dwarfs the existing market cap. Read up on what it means. You don't have to secure them yourself. You can buy through a broker. You can channel it through tax free options. It'll be regulated properly. Many people buy and hold bitcoin just for the fun of owning some bitcoin. They usually buy 1 btc and be done with it. If they want to hold bitcoin as an investment, an ETF is certainly an easier method.Will they get in? Prolly not.Alright. It looks like some markets are boing opened where institutional investors could get in (Noble market-whatever, the pink sheets Silbert thing, etc)There was a lot of hype around Coinbase because ""regulated!! OMG so much liquidity! volatility will decrease! institutional investors are coming! mooooon! NSYE!"". Well, look at it now, nobody is using that ""regulated"" exchange. Less than a million on the order books and nobody cares.In 2014 Silbert promised that ""Wall Street was going to enter bitcoin in a massive way"" while a lot of investors of his second market fund have been totally screwed (bagholding since higher and they still can't withdraw (redemptions) anything for now). Other venture capital big guys like Tim Draper and Bill Miller are bagholding pretty hard too.^^^This.Whether anyone wants to invest is a different question, but there's never been anything quite like it before. However I'm pretty sure that GBTC will get more than 70 million USD in the first year.It's foolish to think that an offer on OTCQX is going to get Bitcoin to $100,000+. ;Actually that's precisely what a lot of smart investors do. After a market crash prices are relatively cheap so it's attractive to buy if you are looking to hold long term.The expression be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful holds true here. Thats the way to make profitI was under the impression that China does the bulk of the btc speculating?US investors have had an investment option forced onto them via zero interest rates for years: the stock market. People will ride that wave til the end thinking they'll time the market. The flow on from this, coupled with the relatively negative press of the last year post Gox might offer a partial explanation of the lack of comparative price speculation from US investors. technicals not works in bitcoins/Technicals DO work in Bitcoin just like they work in anything else.; Have you noticed how it's bounced off that 14 month resistance line many many times?; However, technical analysis patterns are generally broken at some point in time.; I think we are nearing that time to break out, and I believe the Silbert ETF could be the development that does it.Technicals if it can guarantee at least 60 percent chance of winning that is already good enough. So usually it will only apply in condition where there is no major news announcement expected. I don't know about you but for me, I haven't really find out one that can have that success rate, and which is why I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to so-called detailed analysis."

55,1003919,3/30/2015,have such a question was raised every year
56,1004008,3/27/2015,"Where do you think the price will be at the end of March?Technical Indicators: Strong Sell (1 Buy 7 Sell 3 Neutral)Moving Averages: Neutral (6 Buy 6 Sell)Current Mood: BearishConclusion (On Daily Charts)If the price attempts a reversal from the current channel, price is expected to retest the 240-242 area once again. Setting your stop loss near 245 will ensure a timely exit with a nice risk reward.As price holds itself above the 250 support level, we can expect a smoother ride towards the initial upside target of 258, or a value just shy of it. We therefore recommend our readers place their long positions just below the aforementioned level (you can also wait for a better entry point in case smaller corrections appear, though make sure the entry point remains above 251).As you can see in the chart above, the bitcoin price is trending below the 50H SMA, while the RSI has just crossed above 50 to establish a neutral scenario. Meanwhile, the MACD blue curve has also moved right above the saffron signal curve, though is currently situated in a negative territory. The technical indicators indicate a near-term bullish scenario, waiting to be shaken by a single large sell-off.What to Expect Today?At press time, the bitcoin price is hinting to extend its bullish correction, and is hoping to retest 258 as its next upside target.The Bitcoin price unexpectedly broke out from the bearish range towards 236 and started to move upwards, setting its resistance break just near 248. The market started to move and the price managed to pass above the psychological upside risk near 250, forming a daily high near 252.We predicted the bitcoin price would test 240 as its strong support level. The aforementioned level had previously incited a strong bullish rally and therefore was hinting as a reliable downside risk after the previous upside correction towards 250. We also feared that that the bitcoin value was extending its downward momentum and retesting the presumed bottom near 236. The latter however didn\x92t happen, thanks to favorable buying pressure near the 240-242 area that helped stage a wonderful recovery.March 26th Bitcoin Trading sessionWe think the bitcoin price has taken a slight hit this week as a result of the bitcoins that were stolen from Evolution Marketplace customers last week. The price however seems to be picked up. THAT'S HOW BITCOIN WORKS!Now you buy more stolen coins and then when it goes up a little the next thing is hacked and dumped. Bitcoin works like this: faithful idiots keep buying coins which have been stolen FROM THEM previously. This repeats over and over again. The stolen coins you buy today get stolen from you and dumped again next week and you will buy them again just so they can be stolen and dumped again! fatty karpeles was just done with dumping his coins, then the silk road auctions, then evolution scam. ""Slight dip""? 15% is 'slight dip'?!Yes there have been a few setbacks though the positives far outweigh the negatives. Stripe are now accepting bitcoin and there has been 100% user adoption growth year on year with Blochchain reporting its 3 millions bitcoin wallet.There is so much money being invested into the bitcoin market at the moment. Take the Coinbase $75m capital raise for example. http://www.wsj.com/articles/coinbase-raises-75-million-in-funding-round-1421762403 I think there is a little more to bitcoin than you have suggested. I'd greatly appreciate it if you'd try a little harder.; Seriously.here you go mate!Unfortunately this is true. I got scammed out of .4 btc and I ended up buying more btc.always see Bitcoin 2.0, but yet see it.If i had to guess, I'd reckon that BTC will shoot up in price over the next 2 years regardless of Evolution or any of its counterparts. It's kind of obvious a huge margin of BTC Pricing relys on the DarkWeb Markets. When silkroad went down, the market took the biggest hit i'd ever seen. That was back when BTC was around 150$ per btc. Popularity is growing, and so is the price. So i think as long as their are fools willing to risk using darkweb and getting into bitcoins the price will continue to go up. It happens I'm sure, but it would be a bit of a stretch to suggest that it's an all encompassing theory of everything Bitcoin.In the short term everyone is waiting for the evolution coins to get dumped. Regardless of the exact figure, there were a huge amount of coins on that market and if they are dumped it will crash the price. It's difficult to foresee what would happen. For instance just 2 weeks ago the rise was pretty fast and we expect it to breach 300 level but that did not happen. When it drop there was also quite a strong buying support that keeps the price from dropping further so it's kind of balanced right now. Anything could still happen and even the order book saying the sentiment is towards downside, a sudden large buy order could change everything."
57,1004008,3/30/2015,"Evolution is affecting bitcoin, but now so fast.Might be a small pump when Agora comes back online as people buy BTC to make orders.Evo is gone and Agora's been down for the past 72 hours or something while BTC has dropped.Evolution is gone and the market expects a dump of the stolen coins, but it didn't happen. The market is dropped and bounced back up. Evolution is affecting bitcoin price, no doubt. It will not take long for Evolution 2.0 and Silk Road 3.0 to rise and they will affect the price the same way. Do not attempt to predict trend based on these darkmarkets.well at least i get them backvery interesting, so we get to buy back our stolen coins.... "
58,1004078,3/27/2015,"Another drop under 240 usd is just around the corner.; Is it a good time to convert some to fiat for the time being?You might want to sell, or go margin short, at like 260. Good luck.No, it is going up again just now. This is why bitcoin has massive swings because of the ""ohh no its going down better sell"" mentality that everyone has. By selling you are only making the price fall even further down this is because you are increasing the supply and it drives the price down because there is not enough demand to buy up all of the supply that is on the market.wish you success; may you can try it firstlyBut when threads saying that X will happens usually becomes common when the opposite of X is going to happens. If you think that prices will go sub 240, then it is of courseIMO Bitcoin wont go below 240... I think it might hover around the current price for a little longer, then we might see a nice jump in price. But no one can know for sure.Oh wait, If you are so confident of a drop coming pretty soon, you ought to put everything you have to short bitcoin. And that means selling everything you have including your clothes, car and house to bet on that drop. If you are so confident....So there's that possibility that it can go down?Yeah ""if""...; But nope.; That's why I'm just asking what you guys think.And it ain't our fault there's not much demand. This is the speculation sub forum. there is always that possibility, but the 230 floor should hold strong enough to not make this happen easilyif it didn't come true you don't see these people anymore. they will then create a new account.only whales know what will happen. we can guess as much as we want but there is always a 50% chance for it to come true.I don't think tokeweed will stop using his hero member account if he gets it wrong. If it was a newbie account it's no problem, but hero member accounts take don't grow on trees.This is the speculation subforum by the way.; So that's what this topic is for.; Speculation.If it doesn't come true, then it doesn't...; So what?; I don't care if I'm right or wrong.; Just speculating if it's a good time to convert some BTC to fiat for the time being.will be going under $200 next weekcheersof the price.Its funny how everytime bitcoin price falls, people get so pesimistic, but its natural for corrections to follow after a sharp rise.remains as an option for floor price, but under 200? i dont think so, theres too much positive things happening, and if that was to happen i would go all in , because i believe it would be a massive manipulationcare to make a bet on that one? were now ~245$ and that is after the fall from 300$, the next thing to expect shouldnt be another major drop, altho 220 still But the demand is retaliative to the supply it is the seller fault that there is not enough demand.As for lack of demand, who's to blame?; Blame it on the professional miners or maybe the whales who hold a huge amount for selling. ;I'm pretty sure a majority of people here cannot move the market. ;in this case it's a hero member. but there are people who create each week a new account with threads like 'bitcoin goes to $50 next week' Not even whales, whales can only manipulate at a certain extent. Unless there is a big ass conspiracy of all whales ever acting synchronized, they can not decide the price on its entirety by themselves, in other words there are whales vs whales wars going on."

I wouldn't sell now neither. this is what whales want to do you now, panic selling, thus they can buy and pump this sick bitcoin again, then little investor will follow the pump buying into it, this will lead to another crash by the whalesi hear a lot people talking about weak hands. but in general, how much bitcoins do you think weak hand traders have?"

Are you guys really that naive? ;We are in the institutional investors phase existing the bear trap.

You want to talk about divergence, if there was a graph for the above compared to the price the bullish divergence would be so easy to see. When it takes off again it's really going to knock people's socks off. It is going to be an exponential sling shot. So many people will be trying to get in at the same time there won't be enough BTC available to buy. Also, many sellers will remove their sell orders when they see a parabolic rise, which in turn will accelerate the rise.Exactly, the sell orders will get pulled, clearing the path for a huge rise.; I mean why sell now if you can sell for more a day later?

In the end they are even useful.Sure, the delusions often make you cringe and feel terrible for them, but it's always a spectacle nonetheless.You could write never-ending essays on them.Watching late adopters (the suckers, as opposed to the early adopters who dump on them) and their ramblings is fascinating. A bubble is a very interesting sociological phenomenon.I think you missed this part about OP post:And just to be clear, many of us bulls fully ack the risk involved with bitcoin as an investment, and consider it a very high sigma positive expectation position. Actually, it's probably the most asymmetrical opportunity I've seen, by far, that doesn't require the resources/expertise of a hedge-fund operator to actually execute on.Permabull since 2011 here. Risk/reward now seems about what it felt-like to me in early 2012, though I do think cycles are likely to take longer now vs then, since the ecosystem is larger.Nice! Posting first so you can be ridiculed to no avail once we break ATH. Of course, you are too much of a coward to come back once you get proved wrong yourself, just like all the FUDsters of your kind. This is why you are nothing, zero. You have no value.See ya in a few years.Like I said before, you will not come back so who cares? You will log in again with this account once we break ATH to comfront your own bullshit when you are proved wrong. Bitcoin is never going to die in your lifetime and it will get higher than we can imagine, deal with the facts.You should not delete posts by NotHatinJustTrolling, just to prove my point right: Troll-FUDsters like this guy are only here when the price is low and magically dissapear when we are close to getting an high price again, because their whole existence revoleves around FUDsting, therefore if you eliminate the low price their lifes dissapear as well.This is very true. Bitcoin is very easy to get in on. No minimum deposit requirements, no credit or background checks. If you can figure out how to buy something on amazon, you can figure out how to buy bitcoin at circle or coinbase. True but too bad we don't have the problem of the amount of people seeking to make an Amazon account translating into making Coinbase or Circle accounts thus adding to the demand around here. Buy and hold til then w/ maybe a little trading and lending in the mean time. I remember the most impressive bull quote: ""This is bigger than Jesus""; I guess this is probably correct.; And for speculation it's certainly crucial that people can buy bitcoin easily.; However, what I'd like to see a lot more of is spending of bitcoin on everyday stuff.; That, IMO, would be the best for us in the long run.^^ Not that they're mutually exclusive, but non-crypto industry salaries paid in BTC is what I want to see.I really don't think that's going to happen in a long, long time, even after bitcoin reaches the moon. Also with Bitwages partnership with credit cards it makes it even easier to spend your bitcoin wage at soon-to-be historic CC payment terminals With companies like BitWage it will happen much sooner than you think. It'll start with small percentages of income being paid in bitcoin, like the employees at Overstock opting in for. You can wet the bed, but please don't pee on my dream. Salaries paid in BTC would create a lot of buy pressure.Just because a service to do something exists, doesn't mean people will use it. I really can't see it happening. Bitcoin becoming a mainstream currency might fuel cause some people/companies to deal mainly in bitcoin, but there has to be a huge incentive to do so in order for people to change. And most people simply don't do remittance or need to deal with foreign currencies all that often at all. Maybe a vacation a year, for a relatively well off family. There might be a decent sized market, but they can always buy bitcoin if they need it, there's no need to receive their salaries in bitcoin. Why would anyone want to receive their salaries in bitcoin before it's certain that bitcoin is here to stay, and won't suddenly drop by 50%? And if someone did, they can always convert it themselves, would they really bother their employers to make an exception for them? Well, I would hope that in the 21st century--a global century--we would have some degree of freedom of currency rather than having it be mandated by some governmental entity and thus having it be a product of geography. Employers could ask which currencies employees want to be paid in, which is better than paying out in a default currency which could be automatically converted according to the employees' preferences, b/c the former causes the employee to stop and think about the matter and also doesn't require them to be savvy enough to use some sort of currency conversion means. Concerning why they'd want to be paid in BTC, I'm sure a lot of ppl would opt for BTC to be their currency b/c they feel that if the majority of their savings is in BTC format, they'll be richer in the long run. I understand what you're saying though. Perhaps the truth lies somewhere between your ""realistic"" ideas and my idealistic ones.But hey, I'm all for anything that will catapult bitcoin to mainstream asap, so I can start eating wagyu and foie gras everyday  So I'll be glad to be proven wrong. I mean I think what you said will happen, I just don't think it'll happen before bitcoin goes mainstream. Bitcoin going mainstream will be what fuels these events, not the other way around. And I'm already here, MJ popcorn gif style. It's a mistake to believe that bitcoin will be rationally priced as a fair percentage of the economy it represents...; What will happen is that irrational bags of meat will lose their fucking minds and drive the price of bitcoin to absurd values.; We are witnesses to one of the most historic moments in the human race, and we all have prime seats.; The next rise will be institutions, and governments will be forced to capitulate.; Last rise to $1k was individuals.; There will be no slow and understandable rise.; Exactly. We can rationally see that if bitcoin was used everywhere in the world then 1 bitcoin should cost 1 000 000$. however, people are not rational so they get greedy and drive the price 10x higher than it's real value is. I wouldn't be surprised to see 1 bitcoin costing 10 000 000$.and a loaf of bread costing $50 000Just like no one in 1990 would've believed that two decades later a share BRK/A stock would be trading at $217,000.; Bitcoin has the same potential, and the network growth to get there faster.not necessarily, but probably. my point is that dollar does not need to inflate for bitcoin to conquer new heights.Sick of reading trolls posting everywhere.Nice to find a thread where all bulls/HODLERS may begin to congregate.Indeed, if you don't own a decent stack of Bitcoins right now your future is going to be extremely boring. The only exciting thing happening in the economics worlds literally. All other stuff is extremely boring to hold long term.A perfect time for a party, would srsly cheer us up.Me too.; I find today's price decline to be liberating, in a way.; Like getting fired from a job & not caring a bit--you've already given up on life when Evo ran away with your dope money.I'm all in. Not foreseeing an insane amount, but I think the next rally may see $1k, and maybe it's a reasonable price, though. Good to see a thread with bulls and bears.

But just a suggestion, maybe it would be more interesting that instead we aim at 1000 level, we could set a milestone in between something like 500, 750 and then only going to 1000. If we need to party, we need to party hard. I'm in guys! $500 would certainly be a nice turning point. If we reached that, I'd start to feel very positive.so we party all the way up?500 would feel really fucking good after what we've been going through."
66,1005504,4/3/2015,"Bullish; Bitcointalk is back online! Woohoo!Ha yeah, well count me in as at least a long-term bull. I think remaining bullish in definite and proven bear-markets is kinda stupid. You're just losing money that way. You're not helping Bitcoin. You can stay a long term bull and still believe in Bitcoin, but please just get out when the price is going down for a year or so Not all of us want to be traders. To the permabull, HODLing provides guaranteed gains over a long term with minimal stress or effort required.Bitcoin has a history of spiking up rapidly. I'm not interested in spending my life watching charts to be sure I catch the train.; The only risk I see is that of not owning Bitcoin I'm saying ""don't buy after an obvious bubble has popped"". We've seen quite some bubbles now and a lot of people seem to be just too bullish to realize that we're first going down after a bubble has popped. Stay realistic is the key, I guess If you're a hodler you just HODL! Same goes with permabulls.So you're essentially saying buy high, sell low?No, but grinding your teeth watching the charts, hoping for the price to go up, right after a bubble popped is kind of self-loathing and doesn't make sense. Get in at half of the bubble-ATH and you're good, I guess.are we in take off again right now?"
67,1005504,4/4/2015,"All the bulls that like to ridicule people for not being bullish have probably costed newbies lots of $ in the last 15 months.; I think a lot of newbie investors probably would have sold a lot earlier if it wasn't for all the bulltards in the last 15-18 months on this forum.; I wonder how many people bought at 1000+ and still hasn't sold yet.If there is one thing we know on this forum, it is that your pathetic attempts at manipulation (when you are short) are to be ignored entirely.How much did you cost people on here in 2011 by arguing bitcoin was overpriced at 2 dollars? The price subsequently rose more than 500x higher.It is much more difficult to rise 500-fold from $2 than from $200. I believe I don't need to explain that, right?I wouldn't know at which point the parabola inflects, but it's really not necessarily true that it's easier to increase the less it costs. This isn't necessarily true. When it's very small, people will pass it off as a scam. Once it gets to a certain size, it kind of brings a sense of legitimacy to it. The difficulty would look somewhat like a parabola, which begins off extremely difficult, then becomes easier, and then gets harder again as it gets too big. He could be right this time of course. But I think he is a stopped clock, a contrarian signal who is probably bitter as hell that if he had just held the 1000 dollars he was playing with in 2011 rather than trading it he would be very significantly better off than he is now..Opening his mouth tends to cost those who listen to his 'thoughts' a lot of money. Xiaoxiao has been thinking the price of bitcoin is going to fall dramatically since 2011 when it rose dramatically. He thought the price would fall dramatically after the subsequent two bull runs when it instead rose dramatically. Surprise, surprise, he now thinks the price is going to fall dramatically after having deflated naturally from the recent ATH. You are right you don't need to explain that obvious and somewhat irrelevent point, no. Who exactly is saying the price is going to rise 500 fold from here? It can rise 5 times just to reach the previous ATH however.Exactly. And then when we reach that point a 10x rise takes us to 10k. And if we get there where does another 5-10x rise take us? Once those figures are reached anything is possible.Bullish.Realized life is good. ;Then I brushed my teeth. ;Woke up today, and remembered I owned a crap ton of bitcoin, along with Richard Branson and Tim Draper.It never happened before, as we have only growing trend going on. People noticed that too and now general bitcoin user is sceptical and as a result we cannot pierce even $300 wall.Good for you. I can't hold as you can. But in the long run I think that bitcoin price is stagnant for too long. 2014 was a weird year Bitcoin has been on a roller-coaster ride, losing more than half its value last year.Good price to accumulate if you believe in the project.Patience my fellow DOTA 2 player.This is why the next rise will be a tsunami.Same relative level of demand, just easier to get there with exponentially more people involved. ;And the base awareness of bitcoin is growing exponentially even now as we speak.1 person x $100 = 10 people x $10 = 100 people x $1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c> kind of self-loathing and doesn't make senseThat's not grinding you hear, it's excited chomping.Are we going to the moon yet?

Last time I was talking about price specifically it was around $300.What predictions? What's the alternative? ""FUDding to get cheap coins?""But yes, I'm trying to show bitcoin's huge limitations to help new people make a more rational decision before dumping real money into this.Cool gif.At least you tried, inca.; Lawl, inca blaming others for failed calls. Limitations? Have you ever developed your own shopping cart to sell something online and sign on up with a 3rd party processor who not only takes a % of every sale but also charges you $x per month, and sign up for SSL? With bitcoin you can set up your own webstore in a few hours, no 3rd party payment processors fees, no SSL, more money for the merchant, better prices for the people. But you're not for the people, are you?Set it up on TOR, as a hidden service, you'll have just about as much business ;You can set up a ""web store"" to take Doge just as easily. ;While you're at it, don't bother with SSL or even buying a domain name.Really? You refute my point about crytocurrency convenience by suggesting I use a spinoff altcoin instead. A altcoin that was created after and only exists because of bitcoin? BTC FTW, maybe I'll flick a satoshi your way one day when your sleeping the street using a curb as a pillow. *fees are low now that miners print money are profiting from bitcoin's 10% a year inflation, wait for fees to skyrocket as block reward is reduced (even more hilarious since nobody spends/moves coins around, they just hodl them).Fees are usually for consumer protection, it's not because trusted third parties are evil. With bitcoin right now you don't have much fees*, but if something goes wrong and a hacker steals your private keys/coins, it's game over.And if you want to avoid volatility converting to fiat you still need a trusted third party and you need to pay fees.Better prices for the people? What about volatility that screws everyone over? ; http://uk.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-crash-drug-dealers-2015-1?r=USIIRC you have a habit of disappearing back under your bridge during price rises, too. Keep on trolling, we all appreciate your public service to ""protect"" people from the evils of bitcoin. You realize transaction levels are at record highs? Yup you're right nobody moves or spends coins. Consumer protection... right. Ebay charges you a fee to list your product, sell your product and paypal (same company) charges you to transact. It's not for protection, it's for profit. Want to buy that warranty for $100 extra? Warranties are another fake consumer protection used for profit.; Bitcoin protects consumers from shady companies that offer ""free"" trials and then continually pull money from their credit card after the fact, you can't pull money with bitcoin. Bitcoin is consumer protection. And if you are dumb enough to store your private keys on your webstore (when it's not requried to sell something), you are asking to lose your money. What about when volatility makes people more money? There are two sides to volatility you can't pick one side. Bitcoiners hodl, don't spend/use it as a currency. Except for drug dealers, those are kinda forced to.http://www.ofnumbers.com/2014/12/19/are-there-changes-in-the-volume-of-retail-transactions-through-bitpay-this-past-year/https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume-usd?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=lol no:""Transactions levels are at record highs""?Plenty of stories of bitcoiners getting wiped out.If that happens, transaction is irreversible, 0 consumer protection, your money is gone.Since to move bitcoins around and spend them you need to be connected to teh internets, yes it's quite possible that a hacker steals yo' shit.2. You call THIS rising prices??? You forgot about your last ~1504390 false calls, but you blame others for their false calls. Furthermore you forget about that the dump3er is always there. I don't care about this weeny bounces, what results in point 2:1. You seem to have a very weak memory (you should practice it in some senior-memory-training) My point is very relevant, as that is exactly where Bitcoin is atm. Bitcoin has proven to be successful experiment so far, bringing the price to three digit territory. Further growth requires substantial and really mass adoption, which we don't have at the moment (and we are quite from atm, actually). Maybe to be achieved in the future, but only under the condition of some really serious developments. Having said all that, I am not saying Bitcoin can't have another speculation bubble. Of course it can, but that would be rather the last one of that kind, after which there won't be much to fix.Exactly! This can't go on forever because more and more people are getting the d\xe9j\xe0 vu moments and start profiting from it. I believe the greatest bubble is still yet to come.Mass adoption is certainly not required. Bitcoin has been into 4 digits without it and can easily return there with investment demand alone.Feel free to dig up those innumerable calls!? "

Wait and buy at 200 if it dips there, is my best guess.One year of a thousand+ year lifespan for this utility/technology.

Many many people are going to lose a lot of wealth while a few gain an insane amount.ya.ya.yo!So your proposal to use this thread as a counter indicator won't work - instead you should always expect more activity here with declining prices. You can expect less activity only with increasing prices, because this scenario is boring old news for a permabull.Problem is that Bitcoin bulls are extremely ""perma"" and their bullishness only increases with declining prices. Actually, in a Bitcoin permabull, lower prices evoke euphoria to buy more coins even cheaper that will inevitably be worth much more in the future.I'm kinda surprised there aren't more.

I definitely don't want another ride to a huge price and then a crash, that causes more harm than good, in my opinion.That is how markets work--huge ride up, then downward correction. Or, huge ride down, upward correction. Bitcoin's growth will be dominated by speculative bubbles just like every other market, ever.Like I posted on another thread, if this is WAVE II that is ending, then the top of WAVE III will be at around $120k/Bitcoin. If this comes to pass, there will be a transfer of wealth into Bitcoin the likes of which humanity has never experienced. As technological development advances, ;and hits the proverbial knee of the curve in the 2030's, the purchasing power of a Bitcoin will rise to heights unimagined - Probably on the order of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in today's money. Even 1 Billion USD/Bitcoin in purchasing power (and beyond) are possible. The value of Bitcoin will represent the future growth projections of the Human/Machine civilization which will be rapidly expanding into virtual worlds and virtual economies as large as those we see today from G1 nations. ;;;so.... you guarantee i'm gonna be rich?Surely there are and have been markets with movements other than ""huge"".; I hope you're not correct that the only think that can happen is large speculative bubbles.That seems like a huge blanket generalization which obviously can't be true.; Every.

83,1005541,3/28/2015,"So why does the price go back to the starting point?If a pump and dump is occurring then surely the one who initiated the pump was not the only one who bought on the up trend. They simply initiated the pump and fanned its flames. Other buyers would buy on the up trend too. Then the initiator does a dump - but they possibly cannot bring the price back down to what it was when the pump started (without making a loss) because they would have to sell more than what they bought.Why does the price go back to the point before the pump?The idea is to cause other speculators to panic buy on the pump and panic sell on the dump.A dump is initiated by a whale. It's not by other small fish speculators. E.g. today's dump has no down trend. Over the last few weeks it been slow up trends followed by big dumps. This means a whale is dumping but the minnows are not. Thus where does the whale make money if the price goes back to the starting point?It's mostly that people don't 'buy' or 'trust' the pump. They rather use the chance of entering a short position at a higher point. It's quite sad, yeah ^^'because other whales dump too, if they see a good pump , in the end only noobs's money are sucked into the pump(and perhaps some semi pro is taken as well)Then who is making money and who is losing it?They rather spend it on ceo, board of directors, traders and the likes in salary.But i do not believe these greeders to take a risk of loosing one of their precious cents they took from your income.Its easy for example banks to easily play with bitcoin because for them the total value of bitcoin still is pocket money for large banks.However a group of large owners would very possible.Well i disagree that its initiated by a whale, especially in bitcoin there are not many out there who could dump btc enough to make a difference.If your theory is correct then there is no organic growth at all. The price is all down to trading.But this still doesn't explain how the price goes back to the starting point. The noobs don't sell in a dump - I think.There's organic growth and productive activity but it would need to be an awful lot bigger to affect the current cabal. A real transaction is a minute proportion of a market dump. I thought that was pretty much a given anyway. A few hundred people at best are probably totally in control of where the price goes. in about 5 years the value is 250, if we start from 0 to today, we can say that bitcoin is rising about 0.15 cent a daywell it's not returning exactly at the same level before the pump, for every pump there is a small correction in price that rise the value by a littleThis is exactly what I am talking about. I don't see the small increase in price. We are back to 245 after all these pumps?yeah, this is due because there are only whales that are playing now, and no newbies, that small correction was probably caused by them i guessThen after the good news is over, its time to not buy in but always sell at each PR blitz. Or having news convicing people to invest / buy whatever good news it maybe. You can see how pennystocks are operated the same way as well. Pump and dump usually comes from news PR, hype.I guess this is right. In the past I noticed that a pump & dump period never went down to the same value. But in recent times it has. yeah, this is due because there are only whales that are playing now, and no newbie, that small correction was probably caused by them i guessSince bitcoin is not a company and does not need money in the first place this process can be repeated again and again. ;It does not hurt bitcoin but is a brutal game for those who fancy themselves as ""investors"". I have a theory. A traditional P&D is done with stocks. You hype the price and let the speculators drive the price beyond it's value, then you divest and leave everyone else holding the bag when reality returns. This causes a collapse of the price and the issuing company may fold as a result. "
84,1005541,3/29/2015,"To my mind people should determine their buy in price when they have degoxed the data over the past few eyars . I think most of the upsurges were engineered and with out them bitcoin would be say $20. But since it would have grown from $2 in only a few years that is 'great'; growth ie it is not a failure. It is just it will look like a crash while people keep showing charts with $1000 all time high from the gox type effects. I am not so sure. nobody knows what bitcoin is ""worth' and if its price goes down to say $100 you will still lose $60 per bitcoin if it goes down further to say $40. That is still a big enough loss in both dollar and percentage terms to make people have second thoughts about buying in at $100I see this sort of comment often ie if it goes below x the large numbers will buy in.I hope you did not bet a lot lol.You seriously bet money on Bitcoin being below 100 in 10 months?;so unless the price is back over $500 the worst I can do is make 23c profit for every $3 spent. If the others come in I am going to make substantially more for my lots of $3.I have then spend lots of $1s on the lower two out comes ie $50-$100 and $50-.but I have happened to cover myself a little with my bets - I have taken a few at the $100-$500 range and will make $2.23 profit for $1 if that comes in. I saw nothing really holding the price up back then and i see nothing now so I cannot see why it would not halve again or more in 10 more months.have a look at how quickly the price has gone down from say $500 in august 2014; to about $250 now march 2015 ie it halved in 8 months.6 months ago, I wouldn't have dreamed about Bitcoin being sub-300, but we are there now.; You shouldn't rule out anything.If anything I think the price is being held down. Probably keeping it as low as possible pre-etf and Gemini This.; I was one of those people who was super bullish on BTC.; I never expected it would go below 500 usd.; And only to find out that the price surge to 1000+ usd was caused primarily by the Willybot.; Unless Willybot 2.0 goes online soon, I do not expect BTC to go up that far in the near term. 2 years ago nobody expected it to go above $500 and it did.; Bitcoin went from being worth less than $1 to being what it is now. It won't disappear just like that, the technology is real and is here to stay.We were going down from a pump started by Gox and the Chinese trying to move money out of the country, but before they pumped it Bitcoin was already stable above $100 for months. Dream on Sure. ;No one is trying to undermine the tech. ;But then this is the market, it could go down to 50 usd before rising up above 300 again. ;Like you said no expected for it to go from 1 to where it is now, but then again the downside is also real since BTC is being traded in the open market. so i see at least in the 2 year horizon a sub $100 price. to my mind when people are uncertain about the level of its store of value it drops in price - and the more it drops the more uncertain they are. but the equivalent to being canned by Google for bitcoin is there that we are not establishing any sensible store of value for it . etf and gemini things sort of help but only at the margins. Anyway there is no Google type entity in bitcoin to kill it off but since its person to person funds transfer does not rely on its price (ie it can be $1 or $1000 and if you go fiat to bitcoin to fiat in a few hours the bitcoin price is irrelevant.Yet google wave was stunningly brilliant in the way bitcoin is in terms of person to person funds transfer (i think the guy who dreamed up google maps dreamed up goggle wave).And then Google canned it - some parts eventually have ended up in google docs etc but it never ended up the ""saviour"" that it set out to be.i spent 6 months of my life preparing tutorial type material to teach companies how to make the most of it. I thought i would make a good living explaining it to people.I was an earlier devotee - this seemed to be the next big jump. It had the aura that bitcoin has/had. it had its equivalent to etf and gemini in the wingsnot really sure how you now this but let me give you the example of Google Wave.Bingo. Finally somebody talking sense.But for how long?Would it even be possible to buy, say, $1000 worth, in any reasonable period of time without dramatically influencing the market?nearer those sort of odds I'd rather just hold the bitcoin itself.That's like half a dollars worth, and then we are back up to odds of ""just"" $10 per $1.

85,1005541,3/30/2015,"It is bit involved. Iwill pm you with how to get the most from the siteI am not betting on sub-100. If it goes below 200, I expect a crash to low 100s but that is for a short time. If you you sit hoping for double digits you will miss out.The lower it goes, the tougher it becomes for it to get lower as lowering by the same amount is much more in percentage points."
86,1005541,3/31/2015,double digits is entirely possible if history repeatsit depends on your starting point for such percentage calculations. only a few years ago it boomed to 31 and crashed to $2 ie 6.4% of its height. if you apply that to the gox debacle where it got to 1200 then a drop to 6.4% of that is $77.

Next halving event is scheduled for the end of July 2016, thus, it is reasonable to expect that the ETF would be launched in the close proximity to that event, but early enough to maximise the profits. Whales are speculators as well.Fundamentally, we have nothing new developed recently, just news that are pure smoke. It means that indeed, price may revisit the levels we have seen two or three years ago and that wouldn't be unusual, as fundamentally nothing changed since then. However, I tend to favour another scenario as more probable for the months to come in 2015, namely more of the sideways boring trend. Volume at the edges of the channel ($200-$300) seems to confirm that so far. "

Or do you trust rigid math rules (vires in numeris)?0 confirmations txs are not secure.Bullshit.But a bitcoin transaction is ""more"" instant than a credit card or bank account transaction, isn't it?

Show us how it's done. For that matter, anyone else who feels like giving it a go.Challenge accepted.Double spending still takes considerable eff and money to pull off. People are not going to double spend on small amounts. I assume you can wait for a few confirmations when you're buying a car or anything of considerable value...In order to avoid problems when dealing with large transactions it's better to wait for at least 6 confirmations. Better safe than sorry.Less experienced Bitcoiners will most likely be a victim as they don't seem to know how things work. Same for stores accepting Bitcoin without confirmations.Blockchain is transparent, it would cost you less than a minute to actually spot a double spend attempt. Double spending is a problem yes. I agree. But you can actually see if the person you are dealing with is attempting to double spend.This is was my personal opinion. Thanks for the attention.If I can add another thing, I am sure in the next 2-5 years bitcoin will be a valid and alternative way to send money without the use of an high fee and obviously the freedom to ""manage"" our personal richness. For example, send money to our relatives in another country... it will be more faster and with an ridiculous fee (just a few cents, 0.03 $).

Perhaps there'll come a time when people complain about how difficult it is to find ways to convert to fiat, but it's not going to go anywhere in a hurry. Bitcoin do not have to replace fiat. Bitcoin can be used in parallel to fiat and credit card. There are situations where fiat is better and other times Bitcoin is better. Bitcoin will replace other internet payment systems like paypal."
91,1006158,3/30/2015,"That said, I don't think Bitcoin is ever going to replace fiat.When dealing with large amounts of fiat, you have to go through financial intermediaries. Your anonymity straight away goes out of the window. Use dollar bills in your garage sale - fine. If you have a million dollars in cash, tough luck spending it without revealing your identity.... Just getting to three confirmations is a pain in the ass. I said I cannot exchange with a person without waiting, this is true and until some side chain miracle starts to transpire, always will be. Fiat, face to face transactions are almost always anonymous, you are on somethingIMO, one of the hardest things about bitcoin going mainstream is the trust problem.. I guess some people just dont think bitcoin is secure enough to hold their funds.In Utah you can pay taxes in bitcoin. More states to follow.You (and he) choose not to. The ability to do it in seconds is there.How can that happen when bitcoin transactions are irreversible? that's what you are paying 3% to Paypal for, protection. But that's on the blockchain level. Transactions can be manually reversed by the receiver, and there is no reason that will not become standard practice just like it is with fiat today. After all, it is not you, the enduser, who reverses a paypal or bank transfer. It is done by others. The main difference is that it is the enduser who sends money when using bitcoin. With present systems, we do not even have the ability to do that.Irreversibility is a feature. It will be useful in some scenarios and less so in others. That said, it also means the user has to have a greater degree of responsibility than at present, which means that a lot of people will not like it for that reason alone.It's because they demand it.That's all. Really, I wanted to address your Tor suggestion!It's a chicken and egg thing. Bitcoin and all the programs that people will need to rely on need to be made dummy proof, yes, that's most important. But even when that's done, If Bitcoin is still so volatile, the floodgates could swing open and you might only see a trickle of Interest. Even if every ""shortcoming"" of Bitcoin or it's implantation were solved tomorrow, and even if you ran commercials telling the public how great it is, the public doesn't possess nearly the libertarian bent, nor the level of paranoia that the Bitcoin community does. and not just that, the public will look at the purchasing power of their fiat, which gets slowly eroded away, look at bitcoins history and cling to their fiat. Otherwise, windows would have long ago lost to Mac, which would have then lost out to Linux. Never underestimate the power of inertia. You can build a much better system, but if people are content with their current one, they see no reason to change. Ironing out problems does not equal mass adoption. QuoteQuoteI think it will take 10-20 years of software improvements to solve our current problems, and in the mean time.... I think the price will go lower. Maybe even for years. Bitcoins have a clear line of ownership, which tor doesn't obfuscate. Splitting up your coins among different addresses only throws off an unmotivated attacker, if any of your spends combine from multiple addresses, that effort is for nothing. So really, all I can think of to truly obfuscate your spending is to spend through mixers; but you have to pay fees, and doing so opens you up to often reported ""selective scams"" and one day will likely lead to large losses when an operator decides to do an exit scam. Bitcoin history is full of examples that demonstrate that giving your funds to an anonymous party won't end well. It might be fine for a time, but human nature keeps winning out. Not just that, but accessing the block chain through tor is fraught with difficulties and attack vectors; no, your coins won't be stolen, but you'll be at the mercy of the exit node you're connected through. Do yourself a favor and Google Tor Bitcoin attack, or ""Bitcoin over tor isn't a good idea""This is actually the reason I responded, because it's a myth that circulates far too frequently. Tie does nothing for your privacy as it relates to Bitcoin; For one, IP addresses aren't used for keeping track of transactions, wallets, or addresses on the block chain, and that's all Tor does, obfuscate your IP address. An adversary tracking you and your spending might examine your internet connection to verify that you're accessing the Bitcoin network, but beyond that, IP TRACKING is meaningless. What you adversary will do is gather up all the Bitcoin addresses known to be yours and analyze the transactions among them, and agaiN, tor provides no assistanceQuoteQuote5. Not anonymous. Not a huge deal but nobody is tracking what I buy at garage sales today if I use the good 'ol dollar. Imagine me buying crap from a guy that turns out to be thief and a drug dealer. Nice eternal paper trail i have left behind. Everything may be solvable, but until it's solved, I don't think it's appropriate to act as if it has been. Code is changeable, by committee. Look at all the drama that's been going into increasing the block size from 1 Mb to 20 Mb. Which is one step towards achieving better scalability. Everything else will need to get through this committee as well, with no promise that it will. Bureaucracy is the enemy of progress, often times. QuoteQuote4. Not scalable. If I solved 1-3 above, the network would fall on its face. He wasn't talking about bank transactions, wires, ach, etc. but an in person transaction. QuoteQuote3. Not fast. I cannot complete a person to person transaction in less than 20 minutes.For us it isn't necessarily complicated, to OP it is though. And I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable if my mom suddenly declared she had started buying up bitcoinsI think. Bitcoin is a roll back. Great fir certain things, remittance, tax payments, mortgage and rent. But for ordinary people to buy random things online? It'll only take a few stories about a few bad apples to make them unwilling to abandon their credit cards. Myself, I don't think that ecommerce would have taken off if not for merchants accepting credit cards AND issuers dramatically lowerinh the liability of cardholders whose details were stolen. One gave consumers the courage to transact in a new way, buying things site unseen from vendors they had never heard of. The other gave them the courage to use their cards on the ""scary"" internet, confident that even if they proved no match for hackers, they wouldn't lose much of anything.So. Transaction permanence is indeed a feature of Bitcoin. But its a limiting feature, which will prevent it from becoming the preferred payment method of choice for a huge portion of commerce. Best example in the Bitcoin conmunity is BFL and miner manufacturers subsequent to them; people who bought with Bitcoin were held hostage. People who bought with PayPal or credit had s method to cancel their order once it became clear it wasn't going to arrive in the time frame they expected. PayPal enventuslly fired Bfl as a customer, and Bfl stopped allowing payments from any reversible method. And that spilled out of BFL; many miners in here were refusing to buy mining hardware unless they could buy it with credit, specifically because of memories about Bfl. Miners, who should be bitcoins' biggest afvocate not wanting to buy the hardware they made their livelihood with for Bitcoin. It was ironic. Yes, merchants can go Aling and send funds back to the payer. But merchants aren't always that receptive to that, which is why people need to go to their credit card companies to force the merchants hand, when necessary. Yeah, charge backs suck, but sellers can build that into their price. Buyers can't build in the likelihood of being scammed, receiving broken merchandise or having whatever they ordered stolen off they're front porch into to price for which they're willing to buy something. I think that what will be most ironic is the company that solves usability issues will likely be trusted by bitcoin users. The masses don't like to trust themselves, they will trust a big company to help cover their losses when they are stupid. I am going to disagree on the chicken or egg thing. Bitcoin can maintain its value without adoption as so many people are willing to speculate, but you won't get mass adoption without better software. This solution is extremely complicated, you would need an all-in-one design and implementation to make it really take off, where the all-in-one is the device, the software, the authentication and security, and even potentially a trusted third part, yes that is what I think.Setting up a wallet is easy. But the more you know about bitcoin, the more you are certain you don't have all your bases covered. There is no way anybody I work with is ready to exchange in bitcoin with a mobile wallet right now. Hell I don't have a single associate that feels comfortable with QR codes.This is exactly why bitcoin is not close to mainstreamNew technology needs people to grow up with it before the full potential can be unleashed. Give it time. In ten years the average teenager will be just as it-savvy as most ""pros"" are today.Did you grandpa understand computers?There is no decentralized consensus on protocol changes thats what scares smart money the most.. Its not any better than a bank yet in that way if people can commit so,ething that breaks the security or against common will.. Thus the biggest win is when there is a decentralized vote applied to protocol changes maybe via a prediction marrket or so,ething.. Then critics wont really have a reason not to convert.Unstable value is the main characteristic of a low quality currency. You can't make any serious financial plans with a currency that's value is this unpredictable. It's only good for speculation, so bitcoin is basically good for only being an innovative gambling platform in the internet.That makes bitcoin's value unstable and highly fragile against speculation.The main reason that makes bitcoin a financial gimmick, is the lack of mechanism that dynamically regulates the inflow and outflow of new coins in circulation.Volatility is key. Once Bitcoin can hold its price like Gold, it could be considered more of a commodity than a currency.Bitcoin will never replace fiat, I mean, imagine bitcoin on forex. With those 20 dollar daily fluctuations, you could make a mill+ everyday.Also never say never you will eat crow with that thinking. I bet you would say people wouldnt fly either or turing wouldnt be able to create the modern day computer or the internet is just a fade?You dont understand.. Us market is $4 trillion a day.. What kinda volatility would u see with a market order book in billions instead of thousands today? Get it?No, the solution to my moms theoretical inability to secure bitcoins isn't for me to do it for her. Because there are billions Of people out there who have no one to reach out to, who the community thinks should be transacting in Bitcoin. You want Bitcoin to take over the world? Great! Now put on your thinking hats and figure out the Risks the lay people will face, honestly, and better, let's discuss actual solutions, not just assumptions that things will be taken care of by some miracle. That's not how it works. We're the pioneers. We don't just claim the land for ourselves, we lead and clear the way. We need to think about Bitcoin not from our own perspective, but from the lay persons. And we need to come up with real ideas for solutions, not just non-descript ""someone else will figure that out one day"" excuses. Transactions are irreversible. And with hackers and thieves having access to virus's, malware, spyware, key loggers and everything else, I'm sorry but that's not just s matter of understanding computers or not. I'm shocked at how many Bulls overlook this, the sheer risk to people's earnings and life savings that people will be exposed to. And that the vast majority of the public is in no way adept to handle, that is coming if Bitcoin is adopted by the masses. Be it today or in 10 years. People even advocate for third worlders, the unbanked, to adopt this. All that will do Is lead to even more theft from those at the bottom of the totem pole ;But there are parts of Bitcoin that won't change. If bitcoin was as widely used as fiat that would not happen to nearly the same degree. That's the entire point of making the bitcoin supply fixed. We are in the distribution phase and there is money to be made and lost, but once mass adoption is there it will only be truly big players - those of us owning a full coin or more, bitcoinaires - who will be able to make a living speculating on it.Fiat values fluctuate wildly too. The dollar used to be worth 5 of my local currency. Now it's over 7. In just a matter of months too.There is no form of currency that is as stable as you and the other guy want. Just not possible.Gold has lost a third of its value in recent times. After gaining many times what it used to be.Most people are not comfortable carrying around more money than they need for a bag of groceries. Your argument against bitcoin is not new, it is a fact of everyday life within the current fiat system. The future bitcoin banks will charge fees for handling peoples business for them, just as banks do today. They have merely not been made yet. But they will.There will, eventually, be bitcoin banks. They will work just like the current ones do except that people keep bitcoin there instead of fiat.When the market cap. would rise, then the only thing that would happen, is that control over speculative game would go from the hands of small speculators to larger financial institutions. Fixed coin supply is overly simplified and naive mechanism that would actually concentrate financial power a lot more then it currently is concentrated.It's a little hard to keep a serious face, when someone tries to tell me that the fluctuation of dollar value and bitcoin value are anywhere near the similar level.Development into the field of Threshold signatures is where it needs to go. The second issue I have is that multi-signature transactions require too much background knowledge and can be burdensomeUntil that is handled we can't grow much in terms of adoptionOne I have is that people do not trust holding their own money, and thus rely on exchanges once those exchanges fail collapse or run away with the coins the benefits of low cost transactions are nullifiedThis seems like an interesting thread Bitcoin doesnt replace fiat, society will slowly change and move into bitcoin.; Just like society moved into the internet.; Replacing fiat cant happen, its like fitting a square peg in a round hole.did you watch $/\x80 lately? 30% votality in 3-4 months with a several trillion $ marketcapSo a system where you ( you = central bankers) can (arbitrary) increase the monetary supply at the cost of everyone else is better ?I used to work with clients who invested heavily in hedge funds, and those prospectus' always read that the funds were only meant for sophisticated, accredited investors. Truthfully, it seemed the word ""sophisticated"" was only there to make clients feel good. Most of our clients had no clue, not sophisticated in any way. They just had happened to luck their way into money, either by birth or by marriage, and had ""earned"" accredited status, but we're in no way sophisticated. ""Smart money"" is a misnomer. Big money is more appropriate. http://www.btcreporter.com/2015/03/09/what-happens-if-crypo-wins-one-scenario/Here's my essay about a future of Bitcoin that includes banks, lending, paper currency, etc:I've mentioned Bitcoin banks before, and the reception was not well received. Many in the community think that the rest of the world wants to, can, and will be able to be their own banks, but if we're truthful we'd note that that ability only falls to a few of us...The wealthy are net savers; while the rest break even or go into debt; with given enough time and a currency of absolutely fixed supply, ALL of the wealth will trickle up to the business owners. It's just, what, ""monetary physics"". If you have one piece of the population whose savings perpetually go upwards, what's left for the rest of the population will decrease and decrease until eventually, there's nothing left at all. YES!As for the rich getting richer, that'll happen with everything. Perhaps Bitcoin's qualities might magnify that, but at the same time it's available to everyone right now in the tiniest amounts. Obtaining gold, land and other hard assets is beyond the means of most. Bitcoin isn't. If it was a proper success you'd have the reverse problem that users have currently. Prices would rise before you could use it for a particular transaction. It'll be fascinating to see what effect the fixed supply will have. I have a feeling it discounts it as a workable currency and pushes it towards being an asset class if it takes off. -I'll repeat it again, installing a wallet is as easy as any other phone application. If you can't, don't buy a smartphone, you're wasting money.-it's really easy if you pay by scanning qr codes, it's basically a 3s transaction (open the wallet, scan the code, confirm), if your mom can use a smartphone she'll have no problems with it.-nobody said you have to keep a lot of money in your phone wallet, just transfer some cash there every time you run out, just like you put cash in your real wallet when you go shopping.<snip>Mainstream humans don't just figure anything out. If it isn't brain dead simple, they move on. Recent studies say 65% of smartphone users don't install apps, they use their smartphone for contacts, and a map. Also numerous other typos in your article. You are 100% correct on banks coming to bitcoin. Your article doesn't generate a lot of confidence though the title says ""What happens if crypo wins?""; Don't know what ""crypo"" is....Yes fiat currency sucks. But so do currency systems that restrain and hobble growth. The gold standard and currencies based on some other kind of precieved value is again just another layer, another derivative. Gold was valued at around $1900 an oz a few years back. Now it's $1200 an oz. The only thing of value is 'market confidence', or rather our collective 'not freaking out'."
92,1006158,3/31/2015,"The cause for $/\x80 fluctuation hasn't been created by flaws in the financial system, but by flaws in the political system. It has been difficult to understand on why would EU leaders think that they can fix Greece by throwing more and more money at it, or why would they think that it's a good idea to shoot yourself in the foot by setting sanctions to Russia, and thereby giving an edge to US and China. This is the problem of political corruption and ignorance of the people who elect these guys as leaders. If the current system could be changed with the bitcoin market system, then those same corrupt leaders could create even more trouble.So, bitcoin is not only impractical tool of finance for the users, but it also cultivates corruption and power centralization a lot more then the current system we're living in. Most of the bitcoin ""advocates of freedom"" either don't give a crap about freedom, or they're ignorant enough to miss the point on what would be needed to practice freedom. Some are those, who have nothing against corruption and power centralization, and the only thing they want to see changed, is to get themselves in the position of power. Others are just financially ignorant, and have composed their standpoint on youtube videos titled ""BRING IT DOWN!! BRING IT ALL DOWN!!!"".But changing this system against the bitcoin market system would make things worse, A LOT worse. With the current system, there are at least some rules, and those who are in control, are known figures, who can be held responsible for their actions. In the bitcoin market system, there are absolutely no rules. You can freely run an exchange and play on your own exchange at the same time, while using private insider information on your fellow traders, and by that giving yourself the needed edge. And if you get caught, then nothing happens, since it's not even required for you to be known to anyone. You can be de facto ""Emperor of Bitcoin"" by ownining enough coins and owning the major exchanges, while still being unknown to everyone else. This deletes any need for being responsible.I agree that the human factor in central banking can still cause trouble, by not providing perfect enough neutrality and objectivity while practicing control.But going back to the fiat issue, its simply competing against the dollar that everyone knows about it thats been around for awhile. Versus trying to do all that in a short span of time in not even possible, and to get users to leave completely away from it is impossible. Being on this forum is like an early stage itself, since most will never know where to go besides the reddit/r/bitcoinUnder the keyword of ""trust"", is a huge thing but on a global scale that once people know about it. I run into so many faces that still dont know or ever heard of bitcoin and it amazed me that I`m still in front of the early stages.The only reason why I see bitcoin doesnt replace fiat, is because its not known as a official currency that most people trust.In most cases, inability to save is a matter of lack of discipline. Anyone in a first world country has the mathematical ability to spend less than they earn. Just not the mental capacity.They are the ones with the most to lose or gain thus depending on their risk tolerance will be last to join... Because they can live off of interest if greed hasnt gotten the best of them.for a possible keylogger on your phone, use something that hide your key-strokei think it's better to not store any bitcoin in your smartphone, but use teamviewer/any other good remote-desktop software, and control your pc with the bitcoin client(this pc isn't the same pc that you use to surf or download stuff, you need another one dedicated to bitcoin only), spend them from there everytime100% anon basically don't exist yet, i'm talking about money transactionswell no, it's just that they don't take action, but they know about it, so it's not anonymous at allI agree with most of the points but the time necessary for the mass adoption. I think it is shorter than 10-20 years, before we really see mass adoption, although some adoption problems may be not solved even in 20 years, e.g., generation of people who is now 60+ will hardly ever turn to Bitcoin. They don't want to make their everyday life more complex than it is now."

A multiheaded dragon...; Cool. Upcoming weeks target is around 170-180, stabilize there for a few days up to a week, then hard down to around 100 where we will face some serious resistance that may cause a small dead cat bounce. After that cat dies, bitcoin will likely sink into the forgotten depths to double And single digits to be laughed at in the future.I believe that 1 BTC will go back to 1000 one day. The only problem now is only the time it needed.True.; But it could go down first then stay down for a long time before going up.Bitcoin is a free market. We decide the price of Bitcoin. That basically means we don't think Bitcoin is currently worth $300.Is it coincidence, or is a group of traders heavily manipulating the price. But then again, why would they keep Bitcoin down as they had plenty of time to buy in already.For some reason once Bitcoin nears $300 level something happens or bad news shows up and it falls down to below ~$250 level again.lol. kAs more and more bitcoin is mined and the supply increases . I expect the volatility to increase. And the price swings to a lower value more likely. the problem is with the ""we"", right now are the whales that decide the price of bitcoin, they don't keep it down, they aim at fish that buy coins, then they dump hard, hence repeat, this is why you see those crashI lost $2 because of the price fluctuation from $280-$245 because I owned about 0.06 BTC. It's currently on a decline and so it might reach $230-$220 soon not $500.Re: where next?That's right and the answer to his question is: no, it's not coincidence! Yes, the price is manipulated by people, who hold thousands of coins and want to have more. If you wanted to liquidate at stable prices you wouldn't dump it all at once, right? If you see a flat line and then suddenly somebody dumps 2000 coins at once you should know what's going on +1The only one laughing here will be the ones that hold, and you will be too much of a coward to deal with the humiliation of being proved wrong on every single FUD comment you made, just like every single FUDster ever will disappear after the price goes up again. Another old user that sold his coins in panic and is scared that Bitcoin turns out a success in the future,The next long squeeze has yet to come. Lower prices are basically guaranteed to happen.By just holding you are losing money... Not the best idea.You will make money on the next big dump and then, if you still believe in bitcoins success, buy back in again at a lower price. You will end up with more money/coins than before.But why hold? You can sell now and short bitcoin.This is what these salty trolls that are now whining in this part of the forum advised in February. When it started going up they thought it's just trap, a small pump, and missed the whole run to $300. Great idea, sell now and hope you will find the right spot to buy back in, provided that it will go down significantly. If by down you mean $10 down it's not even worth moving money to an exchange in hope for a $10 drop, unless that's what you do for a living.That's what happened to many who sold around the 266 ATH in 2013, only to buy the coins back at... $400? $500? What if you -don't- find the right spot to get back in? What if there is no next dump?Same with when they keep the price low, if no one is selling, why should they keep the price low. Because we think the price is too low to sell.Even whales after some time will stop keeping the price high if there is no one buying. Because we think the price is too high to buy.With we decide the price I meant that no matter how much whales manipulate the price, we in fact still decide whether we buy or sell.It's no secret that whales are manipulating the price. Most people know that by now. When will this bear market end? No one knows...Once the bear market is finished there will be plenty of time to buy back in.A lot of people seem to worry about missing out on a big pump. But the fun fact is bitcoin will not go to $1.000,- per coin overnight.But of course do as you please.Well the general consensus seems to be prices will go down.Let us know how using forum sentiment to arrive at a 'general consensus' works out for you over the longer term Anyone can check the logarithmic downtrend line for themselves on bitcoinwisdom.com. It is currently around 330. In June it will be down to 260's.What about the uptrend? If there's a up and a down, we'll never know which to follow Logarithmic downtrend? Didn't even know that was a thing."
94,1006169,3/30/2015,"Bullshit, bears see magical downtrends where there are none. If you look at a bigger picture you'll see that Bitcoin is in a long term uptrend. Those who are trying to make you believe that the prices will drop below $100 are projecting their hopes on you. Let's face it some people don't want Bitcoin to succeed, envy others who bought low and can't stand the fact that they will be never able to buy back at $80 and sell at $1000, like it was possible between August and November 2013. You missed your chance whiners it will go normal now for few days and then again one burst but not very soonAnd FYI, that parabolic rise at the end of 2013 was caused by the Willybot manipulating the market.Nope... ;wish it were true, $500 is a far-away dream for now.These times are the best to accumulate more. We're 1 year and 3 months away from our next halving. That should definitely help out, if the price matters to you that much. I've always wondered why people fear the price. There is nothing to fear. Bitcoin works regardless of it being valued at $5000 or $5 and that's what really matters.Maybe some of them bought at +500 last year.; That's not a maybe, it's quite certain. Due to the high rise in price, they've hoped that it would push further. They bought hoping to get rich quickly. Actually anyone who takes a loss due to this, pretty much deserves it for being a greedy person. yeah right pessimists talks like that for over 5 years now and bitcoin still did not fall back to double digits im sure it wont happen now too there always have been and will be pessimistic peopleNow look up these dates on a btc price chart and compare. On 18 December 2013, BTC China announced that it was temporarily suspending acceptance of Chinese yuan deposits, attributing the decision to government regulations, following a 5 December statement from the People's Bank of China (PBOC).In November 2013, BTC China raised $5 million in Series A funding from investors Lightspeed China Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners.Just a small reminder:Nope? We shall see then. Really, all that rise caused by Willy? That's a good one. http://i.imgur.com/UxXKUzw.jpgk$500 is still far away from nowMaybe around $230 to $250 in this week I'm sure it won't going to $500those people are the majority, bitcoin need their support, otherwise the price will stuck at current value forever(unless some willy bot come into play)there were many newbie who bought at 500+ and even 1000+, those people now are afraid of buying again of course, and i'm not surprised if they told to their friends to not buy anymore until the price is 50 or something, this is another reason why bitcoin isn't risingI think there is no doubt that there is hope for bitcoin, but short term looks like price is not yet rock solid. might be another 6 months before thatNot with Bitcoin, not with any other asset class.It is amazing that we are talking about prices doubling in a week.Such people deserved it. Bitcoin was not intended to be bought and held. It's supposed to be a currency. It's not a problem with being a newbie. The problem is that everyone around here seems to think that they are a professional trader if they buy into a few altcoins and Bitcoin. This is completely wrong and they get burned often. This is why we have drama from time to time.If you are bullish on them long term you try to buy on the dips."
95,1006169,3/31/2015,"The current sideways movement is not indicative of a rise. I think it is loaded more towards a downturn but lets wait and see.It is simple, if it can go to some 370 then the downturn is over and we will see rallies. On the other hand if it dips below 200, it can easily go to low 100s.That is some theory you have there if it can go to 370 we see rallies do we, so not massive dumps? Oh and if we go below 200 it can ""easily"" go to low hundreds because it has done this before hasn't it? No last time we dipped below 200 we flashed to 166 for about 1 minute before going back up to 190-200 pretty much instantly. So yeh lets wait and see would be the best advice lol. OP we won't be going back to 500 anytime soon there is far to much selling pressure from both noobs and whales. You can argue with price all you want, but the fundamentals wont change. Unless something drastic happens, which I dont see happening of a huge new number of users coming out of nowhere to buy it. Yeah, it can go up a few $50 but itll retract to its natural state of supply and demand.If theres too much supply of bitcoin available the price is going to drop, due to demand being less and less.And supply is drying up quickly after many people can't even mine the coin to cover electricity cost, they shut down the rigs and start to; buy coins. Now new coins are concentrated to those large mining farms with high efficiency rigs and low electricity cost, they have dominated the production and limit the coin supply on market like OPECThe demand is rising about 4x year over year, I can feel it on localbitcoins, which is the most accurate measure of the true volume (You never know how much bots are trading on those large exchanges)"
96,1006169,4/1/2015,"Is it possible there is just less supply AND demand? ;Honestly with price still looking weak as ever, I think both supply and demand are dwindling.; Yes there are some aquiring large amounts of btc, but mostly small holders are becoming less and less as they get scammed, cash out, lose interest, etc"
97,1007608,3/31/2015,"Get out of the ponzi while you can!This my friends is the near future of btc.From a few simple calculations we did yesterday there are around 200k stolen coins from the past year that have we haven't been able to confirm dumped on the market. That is a potential 200k dump incoming any moment! If one party starts dumping (if there are more, we suspect there is one big party behind most of the big hacks), others will immediately follow in order to not lose their profit, causing even more panic from other regular parties. Miners will call quits at double or single digits, the network stagnates, people panic, value remains $0.Demand has never been so low. On bitstamp a 6k dump brings us instantly to $0! You read that right, the entire order book is 6k btc deep! (sure bring up bitfinex because bitstamp isn't big enoug, fine, you'll get 10k depth..)Hack and scam after hack and scam.Governments banning and regulating bitcoin.Market being taken over by superior altcoins.Considering all things.. You have been warned We gonna see sub 0 $ coins!I'm buying tens of thousands when the price hits -$10, w00t!!!!I'll take them ALL at -$1. That's $21M in the pocket and ALL the BTC 10k dump would only hit $227BFX6k dump would only see $195BitstampWhile I think your doom posts are a bit more thought out than most, those depth numbers a plain wrong.There has been talk of this epic dump for months. ...perhaps Bitcoin is strong and there is a Huge Rally coming? Doom and gloom is the reason why investors are pouring ""countless millions"" into Bitcoin related companies, or....I almost had an argument with the guy, but I can see why. My friend who I introduced bitcoin got scammed not long ago, luckily it was too much. But, he told me after grabbing lunch with him, because of that experience he prob just watch bitcoin and explained no point on buying the damn thing.I feel the same way with all the alt coins pump and dump, but theres way too many of these now. We have like 100`s of alt coins, and also again with the non stop scam etc which makes btc less trustable.Op, has the right sense of where its going or headed.Try to put yourself in his shoes...; He doesn't really need bitcoin, unless he wants to buy some and hold it for a while, hoping it will go to the moon.; Mainstream is finally waking up.Interest in Bitcoin Grows on Wall Street Would have been absolutely laughable for the following article to run on WSJ 1 year ago:What are the ""superior"" alt coins?And that's a blog btw... ;The writer/s prolly bought some at these levels and are hyping bitcoin, then dump them for easy profit. You know the usual...You really believe what they write in the WSJ? ;That shit is like entertainment for finance guys. ;Most of what they print are laughable and the authors are nothing but talking heads. ;And ordinary people like us suck on it like it's the info to have to help us achieve financial indpendence. ;LOLDashcoin? It still relies on bitcoin for a priceI think the superior altcoins he is referring are XPY and LTC By superior, I think he meant tech superiority. ;Although there ;really are some out there, it is debatable.This post made me realize how completely bored I have become with this forum. any dump that will bring bitcoin in double digit will see a pump that it will return it to triple digit in no timei would welcome any big dump, since it would provide a huge chance to buy tons of bitcoin(especially for newbies)Another one who's been around since 2010 but still never managed to get rich? smh...I wonder what would happen if someone put in a $10 million dollar market buy order.; There's about four hundred billionaires in the world who could do that without even noticing the effect on their bottom lines, so it seems more probable than your scenario.; And that doesn't even count the hedge fund managers (hundreds) who could do it with other people's money.what evidence is there that they are slightly interested with any buy orders They could make a massive difference but wishful thinking right nowNot much seems to be going on to spread the idea of bitcoin by current bitcoiners either. Possibly because it sounds like a ponzi to most people when you tell them about it.The people are the biggest obstacle to bitcoins success on several levels.It doesn't take much to cause the price to go up, that's true, the concept remains great and its highly undervalued for that specially on a global economic scale. Problem is people don't care for that, they care for beer and football. Oh yea and many dollars to get that latest big 4d vision TV.yeah the problem is that the world is full of people who seemingly love to carry debt.; whether its credit cards, car payments, etc, they dont ""own"" their posessions.; With btc you have to buy it up front, then use it for expenses.; People dont like that, they want everything and they want it before they can actually pay for it.; This is why there is no demand for btc.The people will miss out and stampede onboard last when all the greatest gains are already made. This is always the way of thingsI am still leaning to sub $100 but this ""EPIC CRASH"" has been coming since December.. tomorrow is april.I agree with this.Last, bitcoin is not a ponziThird, 200k won't make bitcoin price become single digit or $0. I'm sure many people (include me) will buy these dumped coinsSecond, Government cannot control bitcoin. They only can control bitcoin exchange siteFirst, bitcoin is still number 1 among all altcoin in Market Cap & Trading Volume, check at coinmarketcap.comGet ready for sub-zero coins!I'm going to dump all my 6K coins on stamp all the way. I think the lowest we will go is maybe 160-180.; Depends on how many stop losses are triggered.Tomorrow going to be a big thing for Bitcoin right? I have placed my order please sell your way to $0.April Foolz!! bitchesIt would be funny if there would be no dump, but a massive pump!I have a dinner with Mr Buffett tonight and we gonna discuss the final dump of BTC which is just rat poison.It will go sub-0 so put your bids from -$5 to -$15. Desperate sellers will pay you if you accept their plagued coins.@OP: just so we are on the same page, what is a huge crash to you? Was the last year's correction a crash or not? As they say, tomorrow never comes.; It is always coming next week; Also, people don't realize it but OP is a snake oil manipulator who spreads FUD to minimize the price so he can continue collecting himself; No serious player is investing in alt coins. Lol @ ""superior alt coins"" If you don't believe in BTC, why are you asking for BTC?OK, you don't believe in BTC, please delete your signature.Kwukduck. Mining in 2010. Boy have you sunk low.Guys get out the white flags!That's it!We are doomed! ;  Awesome!Another devilish prediction by kwukiducki! Is there where the pump and dumpers come to try and move the market? There was a thread named ""Let's make the Bitcoin price high!"" Yeah! Why not? Let's do it!!! ;So many people expect a drop I see, but why not make the price insanly high for a change? I just want to point out to you that BitCoin is an altcoin.No serious player is investing in alt coins.; And whay is so superior on so mentioned coins? Idon't see anything superior on them at all.Why not?well, altcoins may constitute some part of your portfolio, if you are aware of the underlying risks and you have the stomach to accept them. Litecoin is the only other coin I would consider holding atm.Holding Litecoin in the long term wouldn't bring you much, just check where the price was one year ago.Well, with my post I did not mean a long-term portfolio, but short-term and more risky exposure.Well if bitcoin rallies again it will get pulled up with it.; I have some, but not to much..if it goes back to around $1.20 I will pick up a few more and just hold it to see where it goes.Some people keep on saying it`ll rise, but I see more less events creating a user base for bitcoin.Still in the 200 range, and the only spike where it lifted off like crazy was the obvious mt.gox price manipulation which lead to $1,000.I would also add on look at the prices of bitcoin 3 years or 2 years ago.cheersimho the crash is already overJudging by previous experiences, the bulls return is foretold to happen on the night of blood moon (ancient hodler proverb),3 days to go..http://9gag.com/gag/aVWg4E8Why so pesimistic, use current prices to buy more, dont u know whats comming in just 3 days? Meanwhile in real life important people with important money (aka the opposite of OP, using an obvious bought account to FUD or an obvious idiot that sold all of his BTC stack already)realistic scenario: bitcoin price goes up, due to coinbase a private company now being a IPO and has traditional investors.the answer is already there, most are too blind because they dont face realistic scenarios. Creating services and all that stuff, its great, but most of those investments are just play money from a big whale. Thinking it`ll become the next paypal boat and become rich. They fail to know to honestly ask them self, would they abandon the dollar just use bitcoin.Yeah, those are the entreprunuers trying to build the 2nd community for the coin."
99,1007608,3/31/2015,"Best. promotion idea. evar.I would like to one day throw a party where the cost of admission would be some token amount of BTC that, and here's the catch, has to be sent from an address with a minimum amount of bitcoin in it. In my neck of the swamp, it would prolly be 1 BTC, but bigger more lavish parties could be planned where each guest had to have provable holdings of thousands. but rich ppl tend to be boring. Poor people may find rich people boring, but smart people find dumb people even more boring. Successful party hosts do not depend on the guests to make the party fun. The host provides the entertainment and if guests add to that, it's just a bonus. Besides bitcoiners aren't just rich. They're smart. The dumbest whales I know of are still Harvard grads who took Mark Zuckerberg for $50 million. or spam threads in the main discussionOr flame wars in the alt sectionJust read some of the posts regarding martingale or gambler's fallacy in the gambling section. You must be new on this forum. There's a difference between forum members and holders of substantial amounts of bitcoin. True, some of them are not particularly intelligent, but in aggregate, we are a brainy bunch. Even those who aren't particularly cerebral such as Adam or Bitchick still have qualities that make them enjoyable company.The main events of the evening would be to sing different choral songs together, like ""Help me, Bitcoin; you're my only hope of becoming rich"" or ""None Can Heal a Hurting Heart like Satoshi"".When someone would actually have fun at this party, then he would probably be called a troll before being ignored.Wet dreams of becoming the new elitist jerks.Yeah, you're not invited. what is this, 19th century england? the guests are what make a party. i've never went to a party to be entertained by a host. i go there to check out some music and socialize.They had some awesome parties in 19th century England. Only my parties will have hostesses from the nearby university instead of servants. Part of the appeal is that there won't be guests like you there. The rpietila is strong in this one..it would be such a travesty to have guests who actually contribute to the party instead of those who depend upon some host's agenda concerning how the party will unfold. at a party, all that matters is the here and now and everything else can stay at the door. including jobs, net worth, education, blah blah blah. and i've yet to see a college/university crowd contribute to a good party. when i was in college i stayed well away from those ""parties.""Risto would be an honored guest and any party with him in attendance would be more appealing to me. You seem to think in binary terms. It's not all one way or the other. The best parties have an element of structure that is open to some variance.; Charades with tea or hookers and blow orgies are equally poor outcomes. ? That was in the context of talking to a person who either didn't recognize or didn't respond to a specific economic incentive.; That's not binary. Some people may want to visit the Philippines to visit the Philippines to make a profit, others may want to visit regardless of profit and still others may not want to go there at all.; Most, I imagine, would go if their individual profit threshold or vacation discount was reached whatever that may be.one of the benefits of having cerebral ppl such as yourself around is that you know they can justify/rationalize about anything, really.Here's the funny thing about hypocrisy: It's much easier to spot in others than it is to detect in one's self. That's a property of all error, actually.i'll wear a colonial wig along with the others at the party but don't you dare point out how hypocritical it is.I wouldn't do that. It's going to be a party, not Dinner for Schmucks.They are here in an pathetic attempt to make dollars.If you think bitcoiners are here for the technology and principles, you're dead wrong. Yes, bitcoiners vare very smart, losing money every day.Some of them also have mental health issues."
